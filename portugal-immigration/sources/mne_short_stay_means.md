Means of subsistence

For a foreign citizen, holder of a Schengen visa, to enter and stay in Portugal , the holder should either have or be able to legally obtain:

75 € for each entry;

40 € for each day.

Alternatively, a statement of responsibility signed by a national citizen or legal resident may be presented.

INFORMATION ON MEANS OF SUBSISTENCE FOR EACH MEMBER STATE, IN CASE OF REPRESENTATION:

Austria

Pursuant to Article 41 (2) of the Aliens Act, aliens shall be refused entry at the border if they have no place of residence in Austria and do not have sufficient means of subsistence to meet the costs of their stay and return.

However, there are no reference amounts for the above. Decisions are made on a case-by-case basis depending on the purpose, type and duration of the stay. Cash and – depending on individual circumstances – traveller's cheques, credit cards, bank guarantees or letters of guarantee from solvent persons living in Austria may also be accepted as a proof.

Belgium

It is stipulated in Belgian law that the availability of adequate means of subsistence should be demonstrated.

The administrative practice is as follows:

a) Aliens staying with a private individual

Proof of means of subsistence may be furnished by means of a letter of guarantee signed by the person accommodating the alien in Belgium and authenticated by the municipal administration of his place of residence.

The declaration of liability covers the costs of the alien's stay, health care, accommodation and repatriation in the event that the alien is unable to pay, so as to ensure that the public authorities do not have to bear them. The declaration must be signed by a person who is solvent and, if this person is an alien, is in possession of a residence permit or establishment permit.

If necessary, the alien may also be required to furnish proof of personal resources.

If he is without any financial credit at all, he must have access to approximately EUR 45 for each day of the planned stay.

b)Aliens staying at a hotel

If the alien is unable to furnish proof of any credit at all, he must have access to approximately EUR 95 for each day of the planned stay.

In most cases, the person concerned must in addition produce a travel ticket (airline ticket) enabling him to return to his country of origin or residence.

Croacia

An alien who submits the request for issuing a visa in a diplomatic mission, i.e. in a consular office of the Republic of Croatia or some other country with which the Republic of Croatia concluded a contract on representation in issuing visas, is obliged to show that he has enough means for subsistence during his stay in the Republic of Croatia and for the return to the country from which he originates or for travelling to the third country.

When entering the Republic of Croatia, the authority competent for the control of crossings of the State border is authorised to require from the alien to present means for subsistence during his stay in the Republic of Croatia and for the return to the country from where he came or for the travel to the third country.

The amount of means under paragraphs 1 and 2 of this article is the counter value of 100 € (in letters: one hundred Euros) per day of his planned stay in the Republic of Croatia.

If an alien possesses a certified guarantee letter of a physical or legal entity from the Republic of Croatia, a proof of paid travel arrangement or similar document, he is obliged to present a proof of possession of means in counter value of 50 € (in letters: fifty Euros) per day of his planned stay in the Republic of Croatia.

A third-country national shall prove that he/she has sufficient financial means to cover his/her subsistence during his/her stay in the Republic of Croatia and his/her return to the country of origin or transit to a third country.

When a third-country national enters the Republic of Croatia, a body in charge of state border crossing control is authorized to request him/her to present financial means necessary to cover his/her subsistence during his/her stay in the Republic of Croatia and return to the country of origin or transit to a third country.

The amount of financial means is fixed at the equivalent of 70€ (in words: seventy euros) per day of the estimated stay in the Republic of Croatia.

If a third-country national is in possession of a certified letter of guarantee by a natural or legal person from the Republic of Croatia, proof of a tourist booking or a similar document, he/she shall present proof that he/she possesses the amount equivalent to 30€ (in words: thirty euros) per day of estimated stay in the Republic of Croatia.

By way of exception, if a third-country national is in possession of a certified letter of guarantee by a natural or legal person from the Republic of Croatia from which it is evident that the guarantor fully assumes all costs related to stay and leaving the Republic of Croatia, the third- country national is exempted from the obligation to prove the possession of means referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article.

Czech Republic

Reference amounts are provided in Section 13 of Act No 326/1999 Coll., on residence of foreigners in the territory of the Czech Republic, as amended, in connection with Section 5 of Act No 110/2006 Coll., on living and subsistence minimum, as amended. They depend on the current level of the subsistence minimum and vary according to the duration of the intended short-term stay in the territory of the Czech Republic:

For stays not exceeding 30 days – 0,5 times the subsistence minimum (current amount – December 2020 – 2.490 CZK) for each day of stay, i.e. 1.245 CZK per day;

For stays exceeding 30 days – 15 times the subsistence minimum (current amount – December 2020 – 2.490 CZK), i.e. 37.350 CZK; this sum shall be subject to increase of double the subsistence minimum for each whole month of the intended stay in the territory, i.e. plus 4.980 CZK per each month;

The third-country national under 18 years shall prove half the amounts mentioned above.

The assessment of sufficient means of subsistence may be based on the cash, credit cards or traveller’s cheques in the third-country national’s possession, or on a document confirming the payment of services connected with the stay in the territory or on a document confirming that services will be provided free of charge. Declarations of sponsorship and letters of guarantee from hosts (in the form “Letter of Invitation” certified by the Police of the Czech Republic – see Annex 33 to the Schengen handbook) may also constitute evidence of sufficient means of subsistence.

The third country national who is going to study in the territory may submit, as a proof of availability of sufficient funds for his stay, a commitment made by a state authority or a legal entity to cover his/her stay by providing funds equivalent to the subsistence minimum (current amount – December 2020 – 2.490 CZK) for 1 month of the intended stay, or a document confirming that all costs related to his studies and stay shall be covered by the receiving organisation (school). If the sum referred to in the commitment does not reach this amount, the third country national shall be obliged to submit a document proving the possession of funds equivalent to the difference between the subsistence minimum (current amount – December 2020 – 2.490 CZK) and the amount of the commitment for the period of his/her intended stay, however, not more than 6 times the subsistence minimum (currently 14.940 CZK). Document on the provision of means for one's residence may be replaced by a decision or an agreement on the allocation of a grant acquired pursuant to an international treaty by which the Czech Republic is bound.

Denmark

Under the Danish Aliens Law, an alien entering Danish territory must have means adequate for his subsistence and for the return journey.

In each case it is for the border control services at the point of entry to determine whether this is the case by conducting a specific appraisal of the economic situation of the alien, taking account of information on his or her possibilities with regard to accommodation and the return journey.

For the purpose of determining whether an alien has adequate means, the administration has set a figure for adequate means of subsistence of, in principle, of DKK 350 per 24 hours. This is the sum which the alien must have at his disposal

In addition, the alien must be able to prove that he or she has adequate means for the return journey, for example in the form of a return ticket.

Estonia

Under Estonian law, aliens arriving into Estonia without a letter of invitation, shall upon request by a border guard official upon entry into the country provide proof of sufficient monetary means to cover the costs of his/her stay in and departure from Estonia. Sufficient monetary means for each allowed day is considered to be 0,2 times the monthly minimum salary implemented by the Government of the Republic, i.e. 130.80 EUR.

Otherwise the person inviting shall assume responsibility for the costs of the alien's stay in and departure from Estonia.

Finland

According to the Aliens' Act (301/2004, paragraph 11) an alien shall prove, upon entry, that he/she possesses sufficient means of subsistence, considering both the length of the intended stay and return to the country of departure, or transit to a third country to which his/her admittance is guaranteed, or that such funds can legally be acquired. Funds are considered as sufficient on a case-by-case basis. In addition to the funds, or tickets, required for the departure and accommodation during the stay, approximately EUR 30 per day is considered necessary, depending on the arrangements for accommodation and a possible sponsor.

France

The reference amount for adequate means of subsistence for the planned duration of an alien's stay or for his transit via France to a destination in a third country is equal to the amount of the guaranteed minimum wage in France (SMIC) calculated daily on the basis of the rate fixed on 1 January of the current year.

This amount is regularly reassessed on the basis of the French cost of living index:

automatically whenever the retail price index rises by more than 2 %,

by a government decision - after consultation with the national commission for collective bargaining - to grant a rise higher than the rise in the retail price index.

As of 1 January 2012, the daily amount of the SMIC (minimum wage) is EUR 65.00.

Persons holding proof of accommodation (attestation d'accueil) must possess a minimum amount of money, equivalent to half the SMIC, in order to stay in France. This amount is therefore EUR 32.50 per day.

From 19 June 2014, where no hotel reservation is presented as proof of accommodation, the minimum amount of money per day required to stay in France is € 120. Where there is a hotel reservation for part of the stay, the amount required is € 65.00 for the period covered by the reservation and € 120.00 for the rest of the stay.

The third-country national must be in possession of an insurance certificate covering all medical, hospital and death-related expenses that may be incurred during the entirety of the stay in France, including the cost of repatriation for medical reasons. This certificate must at least be translated into English.

Germany

Pursuant to Article 15(2) of the Residence Act of 30 July 2004, an alien may be refused entry at the border if he does not fulfil the conditions for entry into the territory of the Member States in accordance with Article 5 of the Schengen Convention. This is the case if an alien does not have the necessary financial means, or cannot lawfully acquire the necessary means, to pay for his stay, including the return journey to his country of origin or a third country, for which he holds a residence permit entitling him to return to that country.

Mandatory reference amounts per day have not been set. Instead, border control officials need to examine each situation individually. Account should be taken of the alien's personal circumstances, such as the nature and purpose of the journey, length of the stay, whether he is staying with relatives or friends, and subsistence costs.

If the third-country national is unable to produce evidence of such circumstances or at least make credible statements, he should have € 45 per day at his disposal. It is also necessary to ensure that the third-country national's return or onward journey is possible. Proof may, for example, take the form of an onward or return travel ticket.

Proof of financial means may take the form of cash, credit cards and checks but may also include:

a legal guarantee from a credit institution authorised to operate in the Federal Republic of Germany,

a letter of guarantee from the host,

a telegraphic money order,

a guarantee deposited by the host or a third party with the immigration authorities responsible for the stay,

sponsorship declaration

If there is reason to doubt the alien's non-cash liquidity, the case should be examined prior to entry.

Greece

Common Ministerial Decision No 3021/22/10-f of 24 December 2007 fixes the amount for the means of subsistence which foreign nationals - with the exception of nationals of the Member States of the European Union - must have at their disposal if they wish to enter Greek territory.

Pursuant to the abovementioned Decision, the amount of foreign currency which foreign nationals of States which are not members of the European Union must have at their disposal in order to enter Greece is fixed at EUR 50 per person per day, and a minimum total amount of EUR 300 for a stay of up to 5 days.

Where the foreign national is a minor the above amounts are reduced by 50 %.

Nationals of countries which oblige Greek nationals to change currency at the borders are also subject to this obligation in accordance with the principle of reciprocity.

Hungary

According to Article 25 of Decree of the Minister of Justice and Law Enforcement No. 25 of 2007 implementing Act I of 2007 on the Admission and Residence of Persons with the Right of Free Movement and Residence and Act II of 2007 on the Admission and Right of Residence of Third-Country Nationals, the reference amount for the means of subsistence is 10.000 HUF per each entry for the third country nationals and for the family members of EEA citizens or Hungarian citizens who are third country nationals and subject to visa requirement.

Under Article 5 of the Aliens Act (Act XXXIX of 2001 on the Entry and Stay of Foreigners), the means of subsistence required for entry and stay may be certified by the presentation of:

– Hungarian currency or foreign currency or non-cash means of payment (e.g. cheque, credit card etc.),

– a valid letter of invitation issued by a Hungarian national, an alien holding a residence permit or settlement permit or a legal entity if the person inviting the alien declares to cover the costs of the accommodation, lodging, health care and return (repatriation). The official consent of the aliens policing authority shall be attached to the letter of invitation,

– confirmation of board and lodging reserved and paid in advance by means of a travel agency (voucher),

– any other credible proof.

Iceland

Under Icelandic law, aliens must prove that they have enough money to meet their needs in Iceland and to make the return journey. In practice, the reference amount is set at ISK 4000 per person. If the expenses connected with the stay are borne by a third party, the amount is halved. The total minimum amount is ISK 20000 for each entry.

Italy

Article 4(3) of the "Consolidated text of provisions governing immigration and the status of aliens" No 286 of 28 July 1998 states that Italy, in accordance with the obligations entered into by adherence to specific international agreements, shall allow entry into its territory to aliens who can prove that they possess suitable documentation to confirm the purpose and conditions of their residence and that they have sufficient means of subsistence for the duration of their stay and, except in the case of residence permits for work purposes, for their return to the country of origin. Means of subsistence are defined in the relevant directive issued by the Minister for the Interior. Aliens who do not satisfy these requirements or who are considered a threat to national security or public order of the State or of one of the countries with which Italy has signed agreements for the abolition of internal border controls and the free movement of persons may not enter Italy, subject to the limits and derogations laid down in those agreements.

The directive in question, which was issued on 1 March 2000 and has the title "Definition of means of support for entry and residence of aliens in the national territory", lays down that:

- the availability of means of support may be demonstrated by producing currency or equivalent bills of exchange or bank guarantees or insurance policies guaranteeing payment, by means of documents attesting to prepaid services or documents proving the availability of sources of income in the national territory;

- the monetary amounts laid down in the directive are to be reviewed annually, after application of the parameters relating to average annual variation produced by ISTAT and calculated on the basis of the general consumer price index for foodstuffs, drinks, transport and accommodation services;

- the alien must indicate that he has suitable accommodation in Italian territory and that he possesses the sum needed for repatriation; he may also present a return ticket;

- the minimum means of support needed per person for the issue of a visa and for entry to Italian territory for the purpose of tourism are defined in accordance with Table A below.

Latvia

According to the Immigration Law, in order to be able to enter and stay in the Republic of Latvia a foreigner must prove that he or she has the necessary means of subsistence.

The amount required is no less than EUR 14 per day of stay.

Where it is indicated in the electronic data base of invitations, or on the form ‘ Ielūgums vīzas pieprāšanai /Invitation for requesting a visa’ laid down by the Office of Citizenship and Migration Affairs, that the host will cover the expenses related to the foreigner’s entry and stay in Latvia, the foreigner does not have to submit the documents proving the availability of the necessary means of subsistence.

If necessary the foreigner must show that he or she possesses financial resources sufficient to pay for the planned accommodation and/or, if travelling with a private vehicle, financial resources sufficient to buy the fuel needed for the journey.

Lithuania

Under the Law on the Legal Status of Aliens, an alien entering the territory of the Republic of Lithuania if necessary must prove that he has adequate means of subsistence or the sources of those means for the stay in the Republic of Lithuania, a return trip to his country or for proceeding to another country which he has the right to enter.

For the purpose of determining whether the alien has adequate means of subsistence, the Ministry of Social Security and Labour has set the appropriate amounts of financial means per 24 hours which the alien must have at his disposal: , i.e. 550 LTL for an alien applying to obtain a residence permit in the Republic of Lithuania and 275 LTL for the members of his family under the age of 18.

Order No. 1V-280/V-109 of the Minister of the Interior and the Minister of Foreign Affairs issued on 2 September 2004 establishes the amount of means for subsistence that an alien entering Lithuania must have at his disposal, which corresponds to 40 € per day.

Luxembourg

Third-country nationals wishing to travel to Luxembourg must provide evidence that they have sufficient means of subsistence to cover their needs. The reference amount required to travel to Luxembourg is that of the minimum wage for an unskilled worker calculated in proportion to the number of days of the planned stay.

As of 1 January 2018 the minimum wage per day is approximately €67.

As proof of sufficient personal resources both for the planned length of stay and for return to the country of origin or transit to another country, third-country nationals must have approximately €67 per day of the planned stay. Proof of the required resources can be provided in the form of cash, traveller’s cheques or credit cards and a document attesting the possibility of legally acquiring the necessary resources.

A statement of financial liability may also constitute proof that the applicant has sufficient means of subsistence, provided it is endorsed by the competent service, namely the Luxembourg Office for Passports, Visas and Legalisation. The statement of financial liability must cover subsistence expenses, including healthcare, and the cost of the third-country national’s return for a specified length of time.

In addition, third-country nationals must present a transport ticket for return to their country of origin or for transit to a country in which their admission is guaranteed.

Norway

According to Section 17 (f) in the Norwegian Immigration Act, any foreign national who cannot show evidence of having or being ensured sufficient means for his or her stay in the realm or in another Schengen country and for the return journey, may be rejected entry at the border.

The amounts deemed necessary are fixed individually and decisions are taken on a case‑by‑case basis. Account is taken of the length of stay, whether the foreign national will be staying with family or friends, whether he or she has a ticket for the return journey and whether a guarantee has been given for the stay (as an indication, an amount of NOK 500 per day is deemed to be adequate for visitors who are not staying with relations or friends).

The Netherlands

The amount which border control officials take as the basis when checking means of subsistence is currently EUR 55 per person per day.

This criterion is applied flexibly, since the required amount of the means of subsistence is determined on the basis of the planned duration of the stay, the reason for the visit and the personal circumstances of the person concerned.

Poland

The amounts required to cross the external border are laid down in the Regulation of the Minister of the Interior of 23 February 2015 on the means of subsistence required from a foreigner entering the territory of the Republic of Poland and documents that can confirm the possibility of obtaining such means, as well as the purpose and duration of the planned stay (Journal of Laws of 2017, item 2122).

The above regulation stipulates that a foreigner entering the territory of the Republic of Poland must possess means of subsistence amounting to at least:

PLN 300, if the duration of their planned stay does not exceed 4 days,

PLN 75 for each day of the planned stay, if the duration of their planned stay exceeds 4 days

or the equivalent of this amount in foreign currency.

A foreigner entering the territory of the Republic of Poland who:

is a participant in a tourist event, a youth camp or sports event,

has had the cost of the stay in the Republic of Poland paid,

comes to a treatment and sanatorium facility,

is a participant in the program enabling to perform holiday work on the territory of the Republic of Poland, which is not the main purpose of their stay, governed by an international agreement to which the Republic of Poland is a party

must possess an amount of at least PLN 20 for each day of the planned stay, no less than PLN 100, or the equivalent of this amount in foreign currency.

A foreigner entering the territory of the Republic of Poland in order to take up or continue their studies, participate in scientific research or training, carry out development works as well as to take or continue education must possess an amount of at least PLN 1.270 for the first two months of their planned stay or the equivalent of this amount in foreign currency.

Moreover, the foreigner must possess additional financial resources to cover the costs of their return journey to the country of origin or residence as well as costs of their transit to a third country which will grant them entry, the minimum amount of which is (separately per foreigner and each member of their family):

PLN 200, if they came from a country neighbouring the Republic of Poland,

PLN 500, if they came from a Member State of the European Union other than neighbouring the Republic of Poland,

PLN 2.500, if they came from a country that is not a Member State of the European Union

or the equivalent of this amount in foreign currency.

Spain

Article 1 of Order PRE/1282/2007, of 10 May 2007, on the financial means that foreign nationals must prove in order to be able to enter Spain, establishes that "the amount to be proved must reach an amount that represents in euros 10% of the gross minimum interprofessional gross salary or its legal equivalent in foreign currency multiplied by the number of days they intend to stay in Spain and by the number of persons travelling in their charge".

Royal Decree 152/2022 of 22 February 2022, which sets the minimum interprofessional wage, published in the Official State Journal number 46 of 23 February 2022, establishes the amount of the minimum interprofessional wage that will be in force as of 1 January 2022, setting it at 33.33 euros/day or 1000 euros/month , depending on whether the wage is fixed by days or by months.

According to the update of the amount of the minimum interprofessional wage fixed by RD 152/2022 of 22 February 2022, foreigners who intend to enter the national territory must continue to prove that they have a minimum amount of 100 euros per person per day , those they intend to stay in Spain with a minimum of 900 euros or its legal equivalent in foreign currency , provided that they are required by the officials in charge of carrying out the control of entry into Spanish territory, and under the terms established in the aforementioned Order.

Slovakia

Section 1(1) of Implementing Decree No 499/2011 of the Slovak Ministry of the Interior on establishing the amount of financial resources required to cover the costs associated with a third-country national’s stay in the Slovak Republic sets the amount at EUR 56 per person per day.

The amount of EUR 56 comprises:

EUR 30 for accommodation;

EUR 4 for breakfast;

EUR 7.50 for lunch;

EUR 7.50 for dinner;

EUR 7 for spending money.

If the costs of a third-country national’s stay in the Slovak Republic are partially covered, this circumstance will be taken into account at the border control.

The sum of EUR 56 per person per day may be replaced by a certified invitation as laid down in Section 19 of Act No 404/2011 on the residence of foreign nationals and amending other acts, as amended, or by a hosting agreement under Section 26b of Act No 172/2005 on the organisation of state aid for research and development, as amended.

Slovenia

In accordance with Article 2 of the Rules implementing the Regulation (EC) establishing a Community Code on the rules governing the movement of persons across borders (Schengen Borders Code) ( Uradni List RS (UL RS; Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia) No 29/07), there is a required means of subsistence defined for third country nationals entering Slovenia for the duration of their stay in Slovenia, until they return to their native country or travel on to a third country.

As adequate proof of existence of the required means of subsistence, a third country national has to present the prescribed amount of money in cash, or traveller’s cheques, internationally recognised debit or credit cards, letters of credit, or any other verified proof of existence of such means in Slovenia.

If the third country national does not have a secured means of subsistence (such as a declaration of sponsorship, letter of guarantee, or paid accommodation as part of a tourist arrangement), the daily subsistence amount shall be used to determine the required means of subsistence.

The daily subsistence amount in Slovenia for individuals is EUR 70.

The prescribed amount for minors accompanied by their parents or legal representatives is 50% of the amount set out in the previous paragraph.

Sweden

As of 15.11.2011, the reference amount for crossing the border is set by Swedish legislation at an amount of 450 SEK per day.

Switzerland

The Swiss Aliens Act of 16 December 2005 (RS 142.20) stipulates that foreign nationals must possess the necessary financial resources to cover the costs of residence but does not specify details. The administrative practice is as follows:

- Foreign nationals bearing their own costs of their stay in Switzerland must prove that they possess approx. CHF 100.-- per day. Students who can prove their identity by means of a valid student card must possess approx. CHF 30.-- per day.

- Foreign nationals staying with a private individual must provide proof of their means of subsistence by means of a declaration of liability signed by their host in Switzerland. The competent authority will give advance notice of the host's solvency. The declaration of liability encompasses uncovered costs borne by the public purse or private providers of medical services during the foreign national's stay, i.e. subsistence costs, accident and sickness costs, and the cost of return, and constitutes acknowledgement of an irrecoverable debt set at CHF 30 000.--. Guarantees may be provided by adults who are nationals of Switzerland or the Principality of Liechtenstein and reside in either of those two States, adult holders of a residence permit (category B only) or valid Swiss establishment permit, and legal persons registered in the commercial register.
