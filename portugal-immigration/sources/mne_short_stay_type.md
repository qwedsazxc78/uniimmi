General information /

Type of visas

The Schengen Visa is an authorization issued by a Member State for the purpose of airport transit or short stays in the territory of one or more Member States, allowing the holder to present himself at the external border.

A short-stay visa does not automatically confer the right to enter the Schengen area , it only entitles its holder to present himself at a border post and apply for entry into the country.

At the border (or at any other border control), in addition to showing your passport with the visa, you may be asked to provide additional documentation related to your trip, namely proof of sufficient means to cover your stay and return journey, accommodation arrangements, an invitation letter/statement of responsibility, or valid travel medical insurance, in accordance with point (c) of paragraph 1 and paragraph 3 of Article 6 of the Schengen Borders Code, and Article 13, together with Articles 11 and 12 of the Immigration Law.

Therefore, you should carry copies of the documents submitted when you applied for your visa (for example, invitation letters, statements of responsibility, travel and accommodation confirmations, or other documents proving the purpose and financial sustainability of your stay).

In cases of transit or airport layovers, you must hold a visa or entry authorization for the final destination country.

The Schengen visa is intended for short stays of up to 90 days in each 180-day period and can be granted for the purposes of tourism, family visit, business, seasonal work, transit, among others.

Short stay visa

Visas issued to allow for transit and short-term stays in the Schengen area. Those visas have a maximum validity of 90 during any 180-days period, allowing one or multiple entries.

Seasonal work visa

Seasonal work visas are issued to allow anyone wishing to engage in subordinate seasonal work, for a period equal to or less than 90 days, in previously approved fields of work.

This type of visa cannot be granted by Portugal by virtue of representation of another Member State, and vice-versa. Seasonal work visas should be applied for at the consular post of the country where the applicant wishes to engage in seasonal work.

Airport transit visa

Airport Transit Visas are granted to allow a person to transit within the international area of an airport, from one flight to another, without entering the Schengen area.

The applicant shall appear in person at the consular post of the applicant´s area of residency.

The visa request instruction should provide justification regarding the objective and conditions of stay. If necessary, the consular post may schedule an interview, in person, with the applicant, to be held within two weeks of the date of application. All documents are to be produced in their original form, including copies.

Necessary documents being considered admissible as well as the payment of the visa fee for the administrative processing of the visa application does not entail a visa being granted, nor does it entail a refund in case of refusal.

When collecting your passport always check the data on the visa sticke r.
