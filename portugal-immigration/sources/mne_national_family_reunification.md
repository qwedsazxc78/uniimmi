General Information /

Family reunification

Foreign nationals, with a valid residency permit, are entitled to family reunification for family members residing outside national territory.

For that purpose, prior to going to a consular post to request a residency permit for family reunification purposes, a foreign national entitled to the right for family reunification should request a concession at AIMA - Agency for Integration, Migrations and Asylum in favour of his/her family members.

As soon as a favourable decision has been taken, referred family members can lodge their visa application request for residency purposes.

Definition of family members

The following are considered family members of a residing foreign national:

Spouse;

Minor children; or any dependent to one of the spouses;

Minors adopted by a non-married applicant, by the applicant himself or the spouse, following a decision by the competent authority from the country of origin, as long as the law of the country recognizes adopted children the same rights and duties as to natural children, and as the decision is recognized by Portugal. Non-minor children, dependent to the couple or one of the spouses, single and studying in a Portuguese institution, when the residency permit has been granted in compliance with article 90 A;

First-degree lineal ascendants, dependents of either the resident or his/her spouse;

Minor brothers or sisters, as long as under the guardianship of the resident, when in harmony with a decision issued by the competent authority from the country of origin, and as long as such a decision is recognized in Portugal.

Fees

Only the spouse or ascendants are requred to pay the fee stipulated for visa application purposes.

Visas granted to descendants of holders of residency permits are exempt from paying visa application fees, in accordance with family reunification clauses.
