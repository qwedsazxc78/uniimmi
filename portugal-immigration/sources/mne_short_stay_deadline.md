Deadline for filing application

In what concerns visa requests, consider the following deadlines:

Deadline for filing an application

Applications shall be lodged no more than six months before the start of the intended visit, and, as a rule, no later than 15 calendar days before the start of the intended visit.

For seafarers in the performance of their duties can apply until nine (9) months before the start of the intended visit.

In justified individual cases of urgency, it may allow the lodging of applications later than 15 calendar days before the start of the intended visit.

Applicants may be required to take an interview before applying. As a general rule, the interview should take place in the two weeks following the requested day. In justified cases of urgency, the consular post may exempt the applicant from being interviewed or concede an immediate interview.

Information on prior consultation

In compliance with Article 22 of the Visa Code, Member States, during the examination of applications for short-stay visas (except for airport transit visas) lodged by nationals of specific third countries or specific categories of such nationals, may require consulting central authorities of other Member States. In such cases, the analysis of the application can be extended for an additional 7-day period.

Deadline for decision on an application

Decisions on visa applications should be taken within 15 calendar days from the date the application has been considered admissible.

That period may be extended up to a maximum of 45 calendar days in individual cases, notably when further scrutiny of the application is needed.
