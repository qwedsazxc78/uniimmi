VIS/SIS - Know your rights

The Visa Information System (SIS) is a visa data exchange system between Schengen Member States. These countries share a common area of free movement without internal border controls. They apply a common visa policy that includes exchanging information about visa applicants.

The specific objectives of the VIS are to facilitate visa procedures, contributing to increasing the security of the process and facilitating visa controls at the external borders of the Schengen area.

The visa applicant's biometric data (10-digit finger scans and digital photograph) are collected. This is a simple and discreet procedure that only takes a few minutes. Biometric data, together with the data provided on the visa application form, are registered in a central database. Data is kept in the VIS for 5 years.

In specific cases, national authorities and Europol may request access to data entered the VIS for the purposes of preventing, detecting, and investigating serious criminal offences, including terrorism. The procedures for such consultations are established in Council Decision 2008/663/JHA of 23 June 2008 .

The Schengen Information System (SIS) is a computer system that supports the operations of competent authorities in immigration matters and, in the prevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of criminal offences. Find out here what the SIS is, how it works, what personal data it contains, and how information is exchanged.

During the visa application examination process, the SIS system is consulted and may result in a visa refusal based on the existence of an alert in the SIS under Article 24 of the SIS Regulation.
