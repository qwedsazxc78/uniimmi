General information /

Biometric identifiers

With the entry into force of the VIS (Visa Information System), when submitting your visa application, if the application is considered admissible, your biometric data will be collected.

The collection of biometric data should be conducted when the first visa application is made. The applicant shall appear in person for the purpose of biometric data collection.

The referred system should be implemented in compliance with Commission´s Decision 2006/648/CE, of 22 September 2006 as well as with the International Civil Aviation Organization regulations.

Biometric data collection consists of the digital scanning of 10 fingerprints (if there is no temporary or permanent impediment for such scanning) and the taking of a photograph, using the equipment available for the purpose at the consular post.

Where fingerprints collected from the applicant as part of an earlier application were entered in the VIS for the first time less than 59 months before the date of the new application, they shall be copied to the subsequent application.

The following applicants are exempt from the requirement to give fingerprints:

Children under the age of 12;

Persons for whom fingerprinting is physically impossible;

Heads of State or Government and Members of a National Government with accompanying spouses, as well as members of official delegations when they are invited by Member State´s Governments or by International Organizations for official purposes;

Sovereigns and other senior members of a royal family, when they are invited by Member State´s Governments or by International Organizations for official purposes.
