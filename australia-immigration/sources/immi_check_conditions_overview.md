​​​​​​​Visa Entitlement Verification Online (VEVO) allows visa holders, employers, education providers and other organisations to check visa details and conditions.

VEVO tells you details relating to your current in-effect visa:

which visa

the expiry date

the must not arrive after date

the period of stay (how long you can stay)

conditions (what you can and can't do).

VEVO is not able to provide any details relating to visas that are not ‘in-effect’. For example, if you hold a Bridging visa but your substantive visa has not yet expired.​

Long term residents

If you migrated to Australia before 1990 and have not travelled out of Australia you might not have an electronic record of your visa. You can request an electronic record of your permanent visa at Proof of permanent residence . You can then use VEVO to prove you have a permanent visa.
