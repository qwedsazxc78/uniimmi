​​​​The Department of Home Affairs (the department) requires evidence of English language proficiency for some Australian visa applications. This helps effectively manage immigration risk and ensure visa holders can fully participate in the Australian community.

We get evidence from several English language tests approved for Australian visa applications.​ Tests may be available in either computer-based or paper-based formats. The test must take place in a secure testing centre.

On 7 August 2025 , the English language tests approved for Australian visa purposes changed. If you completed a test before this date, your results may still be valid for up to 3 years. This will depend on the visa subclass you apply for. You will need to check the:

required English test scores for the visa

type of evidence you must provide

test eligibility timeframes.

You can find this information by visiting getting a visa . More information on the changes to the English language test is below. ​
