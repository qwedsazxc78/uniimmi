​​​​​​​Check conditions online (VEVO)

Visa Entitlement Verification Online (VEVO) allows visa holders, employers, education providers and other organisations to check visa conditions.

VEVO can only provide current visa information about visa holders whose details are available in our systems. You may not have a searchable record if you migrated to Australia before 1990 and have not travelled out of Australia. If this applies to you, you may need to request an electronic record of your permanent visa .

Some people may have an ImmiCard issued by us. You can check your eligibility for an ImmiCard​ . Government agencies can then use the ImmiCard to check a visa holder’s commencement of identity in Australia.

Australian citizens have unlimited work and study rights in Australia. You cannot use VEVO to confirm Australian citizenship. You can provide a copy of your Australian citizenship certificate or your Australian passport as proof of your Australian citizenship.

Wor​kplace rights of visa holders

Everyone working in Australia has basic rights and protections in the workplace, including minimum pay and conditions. Learn more about workplace rights in Australia .
