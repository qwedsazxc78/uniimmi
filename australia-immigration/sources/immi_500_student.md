We will charge eligible applicants the lower visa application cost during the application process in ImmiAccount . We will recognise eligible applicants by the valid passport from the specified countries used in the application when they apply.

Family members are also eligible for the lower visa cost. We base this on the passport of the primary applicant (or visa holder who satisfies the primary visa criteria).

The primary applicant must hold a valid passport issued by one of the following countries:

### Students affected by COVID-19
If you held a Student visa on or after 1 February 2020, you may be eligible to have your visa application fee waived so you can submit a further Student visa application. You may be eligible if you:

have deferred your study as you were unable to enter Australia due to travel restrictions

were forced to reduce to a part-time study load

were unable to complete your work-based training or placements.

This measure does not apply to students who are lodging a new Student visa application because of ordinary reasons, including if you have:

failed a course or unit of study

deferred for personal reasons

voluntarily reduced your study load.

You must apply for a Student visa to have your application for a fee waiver considered. Attach a completed Form 1545 COVID-19 Impacted Student from your education provider.

If you are applying for a fee waiver in Australia, we will not issue a Bridging visa automatically as the fee exemption must be checked first. You do not need to contact the department if you have applied for a fee waiver in Australia and have not been issued a Bridging visa immediately.

This waiver only applies to the visa application charge.
### Include family
You can include family members when you lodge your visa application. For Student visas, your family member is:

your partner , or

your or your partner's dependent child who is unmarried and has not turned 18 years of age.

We cannot grant a Student visa to your child if they have turned 18 years at the time your visa is finalised. They need to apply for their own visa.

You must declare your family members in your Student visa application even if they do not plan to travel with you to Australia. If you do not do this, your family members will not be eligible for a Student visa to join you in Australia.

Your family members can also apply as a subsequent entrant (at a later time, separate from your application) in ImmiAccount .

Family members who apply for the visa must meet our requirements for health and character .

Check the annual school costs you will need to pay for any dependent children to go to either public or private schools in Australia.

For more information see ‘Evidence you have enough money for your stay’ section under Gather documents .
### Apply from
You can be in or outside Australia when you apply for the visa and when we decide on your application. If you are in Australia you must hold an eligible substantive visa. For more information see ‘Have this visa if applying while in Australia’ under Eligibility .
### Packaged courses
You will need to give us Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE) for each course. The last course you take as part of the course package is your main course of study. We use your main course of study to work out what financial and English language skills evidence you must give us.

If your visa application includes a package of courses, course gaps must be less than two calendar months, unless the first course finishes at the end of the standard academic year and the next course commences at the beginning of the standard academic year.

For example, the academic year generally ends in November and starts again in February the following year, three to four months is an acceptable gap between courses.

Standard visa grant periods apply to packaged courses.
### Processing times
Make sure you allow plenty of time to prepare your application. Applications can take longer to process during peak periods, so lodge well in advance of your course start date.

Your application can take longer to process if:

you do not fill it in correctly

you do not include all the documents we need or we need more information from you

it takes us time to verify your information.

Find out what you can do to help us process your application faster .

We can't process your application if you do not pay the correct visa application charge. We will tell you if this applies to you.

For more information about student visa processing times, see Student visa processing priorities .
### Your obligations
You and your family must meet all visa conditions and follow Australian laws.

See which conditions will and might be attached to this visa.
### Travel
You can travel outside Australia and return as many times as you want while the visa is valid.

The time you spend outside Australia does not extend the visa.

  You might need to provide evidence of your English language skills at the time you submit your visa application. To find out the evidence you need to provide, use the Document Checklist tool .

Note: We can ask you for evidence of your English language skills after you have submitted your application, at any time while we are processing your application, even if the Document Checklist tool shows that you don't need to provide evidence of your English language skill when you submit your application.

If you need to provide evidence of your English language skills, you must provide evidence that you:

have obtained a certain test score in an English language test that the Department has approved, or

fall into an exemption category listed below.

At-home or online English language tests

The Department of Home Affairs does not accept evidence from English language tests where an entire test is delivered online (also known as “remote-proctored” or “at-home”).

The department will still accept tests taken before 12 February 2024 and within specified validity periods, for C1 Advanced paper-based and computer-based tests.

LANGUAGECERT Academic

If you sit a LANGUAGECERT test, you will receive a ‘certificate’ and a ‘report’. If you use your LANGUAGECERT Academic results to show you meet the English language requirement, you must include both documents with your visa application. If you do not provide the certificate and the report, visa processing may be delayed.
- English language evidence exemptions
  You do not need to give us evidence of an English test score with your visa application if one of the following applies:

If you are required to provide evidence of English language proficiency but you fall into an exemption category, make sure you provide the appropriate evidence that demonstrates that you satisfy one of the exemptions.

For more information on English Language Tests and Evidence Exemptions refer to the Migration (English Language Tests and Evidence Exemptions for Subclass 500 (Student) Visas) Instrument 2025 - Federal Register of Legislation .
- Have adequate health insurance
  You and your family members must have and maintain adequate health insurance for the whole of your stay in Australia. To find out the length of coverage you will require, see Student visa grant periods .

You and your family members must be covered by Overseas Student Health Cover (OSHC) from an approved Australian health insurance provider, unless an 'Exception' applies.

Applicants outside Australia

Your cover must start from the day you and your family arrive in Australia, not the day your course starts.

If you have been granted a visa and want to travel to Australia before your course begins, the OSHC start date must be the same as the date you arrive, not the date your course starts. Generally this is a minimum of 1 week to 1 month before your course starts.

You must:

ensure you don't enter Australia before your OSHC begins, and

maintain your OSHC until you leave Australia.

You may be refused entry to Australia if you cannot prove you have health insurance in place when you arrive.

Applicants in Australia

Applicants must have OSHC. If your previous visa required you to have health insurance, cover must be continuous with no gap between your previous health cover and your OSHC.

Exceptions

You do not need to have OSHC if you are:

a Norwegian student covered by the Norwegian National Insurance Scheme

a Swedish student covered by Kammarkollegiet

a Belgian student covered under the Reciprocal Health Care Agreement with Australia

How to get Overseas Student Health Cover

To get OSHC:

find an approved provider

pay for your policy

Your education provider or agent might arrange OSHC for you.

If your education provider arranges your OSHC coverage, you will need to know the name of your health insurance provider, the date that your policy starts and finishes and should be aware of the terms and conditions of your policy. Your education provider will also need to include your health insurance information on your Certificate of Enrolment (CoE).

If you arrange OSHC coverage yourself, you will need to know the policy number to include in the visa application.

We will refuse your visa application if you don't give us this information when you apply for your Student visa.

Insurance for family members

If you have a single OSHC policy and you have family members, including children born in Australia after your arrival, consider getting a family policy. Every member of your family must have health insurance.

Any family member who joins you after you arrive in Australia must show us they have OSHC for the duration of their stay in Australia.

  - Evidence you have enough money for your stay
    If the document checklist requires you to provide evidence of your financial capacity, you must attach evidence with your visa application. If you don’t provide this evidence, we may refuse your application without asking you for more information.

If the document checklist does not require you to provide evidence of your financial capacity, we may still ask you to provide this evidence while we are processing your application.

The living cost we ask you to declare and provide with your visa application is the minimum amount of money you need for the purpose of the visa. Actual living costs vary throughout Australia and may be much higher than what you need for the visa. We recommend you research the area you intend to live in, including the cost of living in that area.

For more information on evidence of financial capacity, see the Federal Register of Legislation - Migration (LIN 19/198: Evidence of financial capacity—Subclass 500 Visa and Subclass 590 Visa) Instrument 2019 .

Evidence that you have enough money for your stay can include:

deposits of money from a financial institution

a government loan or loans from a financial institution

scholarships or similar financial support.

Annual income

Alternatively, you can provide evidence that your parents or your partner had a personal annual income of at least AUD87,856 in the 12 months immediately before you apply. If you bring family members, your parents’ or partner’s income must be at least AUD102,500 in the 12 months immediately before you apply.

If both your parents are working we can consider their combined income. Provide evidence of your parents’ or partner’s income in the form of official government documents such as tax assessments less than 12 months old. We won’t accept bank statements or direct evidence from an employer.

Work out how much money you need for the visa

At a minimum, you must have enough money to pay for:

your travel

12 months of your course fees (or pro rata fees, if your course is less than 12 months)

12 months of living costs for you and any family members who come with you to Australia (or pro rata fees, if you are staying less than 12 months)

school fees for any school-age children who accompany you (or pro rata fees, if the child will be at school for less than 12 months).

Use the following information to work out how much money you need for the visa. To calculate pro rata costs, divide the annual cost by 365 and multiply the result by the number of days you intend to stay in Australia.

Living costs

12-month living costs are for:

students - AUD29,710

partners coming with you - AUD10,394

a child coming with you - AUD4,449.

Course fees

Use the first 12 months of your course fees. If your course is 12 months or less, use the total cost. Deduct any costs you have already paid – you must provide evidence you have paid them, such as a receipt or Confirmation of Enrolment.

If you are in Australia and your course has already started, calculate the course fee for 12 months starting on the date you lodge your application.

Example 1: your course fee is AUD50,000 for 3 years. The fee for 12 months is the total course cost divided by the number of years you will be studying. AUD50,000 divided by 3 years = AUD16,666, less any amount you have already paid if relevant.

Example 2: your course fee is AUD15,000 for 10 months and you have already paid AUD5,000. Deduct the amount you have already paid from the total amount. AUD15,000 - AUD5,000 = AUD10,000.

Example 3: your course fee is AUD20,000 for 18 months. The fee for 12 months is the total divided by the total number of months, then multiplied by 12. (AUD20,000/18) x 12 = AUD13,333. Deduct any costs you have already paid.

Schooling costs

If you are including any school-age children in your application, add schooling costs of at least AUD13,502 per year for each child. Costs vary between states, territories and schools in Australia. You are responsible for finding out how much the child’s schooling will cost.

You don’t have to provide evidence of schooling costs if you:

are a PhD student and have enrolled your child in an Australian government school where the fees have been waived, or

have received an Australian Commonwealth Government scholarship, including Foreign Affairs and Defence sponsored students, and have enrolled your child in an Australian government school where the fees have been waived.

You must provide evidence the child is enrolled.

Travel costs

As a guide, when you calculate how much money you need, include:

AUD2,500 for travel costs if you are applying from East or Southern Africa

AUD3,000 for travel costs if you are applying from West Africa

AUD2,000 for travel costs if you are applying from anywhere else outside Australia

AUD1,000 for travel costs if you are applying in Australia. If you will be returning to Africa include AUD1,500.

Include the costs and expenses of the primary applicant. For family members also applying for the visa, include:

12 months living costs (or pro rata)

any school fees

travel expenses.

Other options

Secondary exchange students can prove they have enough money for their stay by providing a completed Acceptance Advice of Secondary Exchange Students (AASES) form.

Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) students can prove they have enough money for their stay by providing a letter of support from DFAT. They must also provide proof of the financial capacity of any family members travelling with them.

Department of Defence students can prove they have enough money for their stay by providing a letter of support from the Department of Defence. They must also provide proof of the financial capacity of any family members travelling with them.

Family members who apply after we have granted you a visa (subsequent entrants)

Family members who apply to join you later must also, at a minimum, show us they have enough money to cover:

the costs and expenses of the Student visa holder, including any remaining portion of the 12 months school fees minus any amount already paid

12 months living costs of all secondary applicants, including school fees

travel costs for all secondary applicants.

Evidence you have genuine access to the money

If we ask you to provide evidence of financial capacity you must also prove you have access to it.

If someone else is providing you funds, give us:

evidence of your relationship with them

their identity documents

evidence of any financial support they have given you or another Student visa holder in the past.

If you are providing evidence of deposits of money, explain their source.

This could include supporting financial evidence, for example:

recent bank transaction statements showing the history of funds

any regular payments or growth patterns, such as from salary income.

Providing a bank balance certificate across a single day does not show us how you increased your funds.

Any education loan to cover your tuition or living costs should be paid out according to the agreement between you, the bank and the education provider. If you receive any payments before we make a decision on your application, give us evidence including the terms of the loan and the full amount you will be paid.

If you are relying on another kind of loan, provide:

evidence of the security you used

the terms of the loan

evidence you can cover ongoing costs.

The best evidence you can provide of genuine access to funds if you are relying on a loan is evidence of disbursement.

Let your provider know of any conditions on your education loan. Some loans offer deferred repayment against your future earnings. These loans can be conditional on you studying only a specified course with a certain provider.
  - Evidence you are exempt from paying a visa application charge (VAC):
    The following Student visa applicants are not required to pay a visa application charge (VAC):

Students awarded a scholarship funded by the Commonwealth Government of Australia

Students affected by education provider default and lodge a new Student visa application within 12 months of the provider default day

If you are not sure, you should not claim exemption. We will not accept your application if you are not eligible and this may have consequences if you are in Australia. An invalid application outcome could affect your visa status and you may not be eligible if your visa has already expired to apply for a further visa.

Note:

You are not Commonwealth sponsored if you are sponsored by the government in your home country or your government has provided you with a loan. Most Commonwealth sponsored students are enrolled in post graduate research courses.

If your education provider is still operating but was unable to deliver the course you were enrolled in, then you are not affected by education provider default .

You should respond to any requests for information promptly. You do not need to wait until the deadline to respond to a Departmental request for further information. You should also regularly log into your ImmiAccounts to check for messages from the Department and respond promptly.

You should avoid booking travel before your visa has been finalised.
  - Status updates
    Do not call if it is within standard processing times . We can't give any further updates on the application's progress. You can see if we have asked for more information in your ImmiAccount .
