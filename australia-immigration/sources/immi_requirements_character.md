### Character considerations
If you have committed serious criminal offences, it is unlikely we will grant you a visa. When assessing your case, officers will take into account Ministerial Direction No.110 . The Ministerial Direction explains the expectations of the Australian Government and the Australian community about whether a visa applicant or visa holder, with criminal charges or convictions, is able to enter or stay in Australia.

You may not meet the character requirements if you fail to pass the ‘ character test ’ as defined in s501(6) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) .

You may not pass the character test if:

you have a substantial criminal record as defined by s501(7) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth)

you have been convicted of, had a charge proven for or have been found guilty of a sexually based crime involving a person aged under 18 years

you have been convicted of escaping from immigration detention, or convicted for an offence that you committed:

while you were in immigration detention

during an escape from immigration detention

after an escape, but before you were taken into immigration detention again

you are or have been a member of a group or organisation, or had or have an association with a person, group or organisation that the Minister (or delegate) reasonably suspects of being involved in criminal conduct

the Minister (or delegate) reasonably suspects that you have been involved in any of the following activities in any country, whether or not you have been convicted of such an offence:

people smuggling

people trafficking

genocide

a war crime

a crime against humanity

a crime involving torture or slavery

a crime that is otherwise of serious international concern

your past and present criminal or general conduct shows that you are not of good character

the Minister (or delegate) reasonably suspects there is a risk that while you are in Australia you would:

engage in criminal conduct

harass, molest, intimidate or stalk another person

vilify a segment of the Australian community

incite discord in the Australian community or in a part of it

be a danger to the Australian community or a part of it

you are subject to an adverse security assessment by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation

you are subject to an Interpol notice, from which it is reasonable to infer that you are a direct or indirect risk to the Australian community, or a segment of the Australian community

you have been charged or convicted of a domestic violence offence or have ever been subject to a domestic violence order.
### When you apply
declare all criminal conduct you have engaged in

truthfully answer all questions

provide all requested information.

We consider all circumstances of a case. Even if you do not meet the character requirements, the Minister for Home Affairs or their delegate can choose to grant your visa.

If you provide false or misleading information as part of your application, we may refuse or cancel your visa .
### Other considerations
Ministerial Direction 110 sets out the other considerations that must be balanced when deciding whether to refuse or cancel a visa on character grounds. These include but are not limited to:

the expectation that visa holders are, and have been, law-abiding, will respect Australia's law enforcement framework, and will not cause or threaten harm to individuals or the Australian community

the expectations and protection of the Australian community

the best interests of any minor children (aged under 18 years) in Australia who would be affected by the decision

whether you have engaged in any conduct that constitutes family violence

the strength, nature and duration of any ties you may have to Australia

Australia's international legal responsibilities

the impact of visa refusal or cancellation on your family in Australia

any impact on Australian business and community interests.

For more information see Ministerial Direction 110 .
### Mandatory cancellation
By law, we must cancel your visa if you are serving a sentence of imprisonment, on a full-time basis in a custodial institution, for an offence against an Australian law because you have:

been sentenced to death, imprisonment for life or imprisonment for 12 months or more

been convicted of a sexually based crime involving a person aged under 18 years by an Australian or foreign court

had a charge proven for a sexually based crime involving a person aged under 18 years, even if you were discharged without conviction.

You will have 28 days to request revocation of a mandatory cancellation. If the Minister (or delegate) revokes the decision to cancel, we will reinstate your visa.
### Other supporting documents
In support of your application, we may ask you to provide more documents. These may include but are not limited to the following:

Military certificates

You may need to provide a military certificate with your visa application. If we ask you for one, it will usually be when you served for more than 12 months in any country's military force.

A military certificate can be a letter from your commanding officer. It should say whether you were convicted of any criminal offence while in the military.

You may also need to provide a police certificate for every country you served in for over 12 months. This includes where you were stationed at a military base.

Police certificates

We may ask you to provide a police certificate (also called a penal clearance certificate) from every country you lived in. If we ask you for one, it will usually be if you are over the age of 17 and lived in any of the listed countries, including Australia, for at least 12 months in the past 10 years.

Police certificates are valid for 12 months from the issue date. They must cover:

the time you turned 16 up to the issue date

or

the whole time you were in the country.

We may ask you to provide a new police certificate if you have returned to the country after your previous certificate has expired.

Apply for a police certificate

See how to apply for an overseas police certificate in the relevant countries .

If a country you lived in is not listed or you cannot get a certificate, contact your nearest Australian immigration overseas office .

To apply for an Australian police certificate you must submit an Australian Federal Police National Police Check application form . We do not accept state- or territory-issued police certificates.

When you apply for an Australian Federal Police National Police Check you MUST select Code 33 - Immigration/Citizenship – for Supply to the Department of Home Affairs. This code includes all Commonwealth offences, and other state/territory offences.

You must include details of all names you have been known by.

You do not need to give fingerprints for Australian police checks.
### Requirements for ship workers
You must provide a police certificate if you have spent more than 12 months in the last 10 years working on one or more:

merchant ships

cruise ships

private yachts or

oil rigs.

The flag of the country that the vessel sails under is the country you should request the police certificate from. Use our location finder to see how to apply for a police certificate in the relevant country .

You should also provide a letter of good conduct from the captain or company of each vessel. The letter should include:

the name of the vessel

the job you had while on the vessel

the start and end dates of your employment

a statement about your character.

If you have worked less than 12 months on a vessel for one particular country, we may accept a letter of good conduct instead of the police certificate.
### Consequences of visa refusal or cancellation
Detention and removal

You must have a valid visa to stay in Australia. It is unlawful to stay in Australia without a valid visa. If we cancel or refuse your visa on character grounds you may have a limited time to depart Australia or no longer hold a valid visa.

If you are in Australia without a valid visa, you could face serious consequences including immigration detention and removal from Australia.

Learn what to do if you do not have a valid visa.

If you do not have a valid visa, contact the Department's Immigration Status Resolution Service (SRS) .

Restrictions on re-entering Australia

If we have cancelled your visa you may have a re-entry ban and can only be granted another visa in limited circumstances. Learn more about re-entry bans.

If we have cancelled your visa on the character grounds under s501 of the Act, you may be subject to Special Return Criterion 5001 .

If we have cancelled your visa under s501 and the Minister has not personally revoked that cancellation or granted you a permanent visa you are not able to satisfy Special Return Criterion 5001.

Special Return Criterion 5001 is a criterion of many visas which allows a person to enter and remain in Australia. If a person does not satisfy this criterion they cannot be granted a visa.

Restrictions on visa applications

If we have cancelled or refused your visa on character grounds since you last arrived in Australia the only visa you can apply for, if you meet the eligbility criteria, is a Protection visa (subclass 866).

If you apply for a Protection visa (subclass 866) and we refuse your application or cancel your visa, you cannot apply again. You can only apply for another Protection visa (subclass 866) visa if the Minister decides it is in the public interest to let you do so. See if you have had a protection visa refused or cancelled.

Appeal a refusal or cancellation

If we refuse or cancel your visa on character grounds, we will let you know in writing. We will tell you why we refused or cancelled your visa and if you have a right to a review of the decision.

The independent Administrative Review Tribunal (ART) is responsible for reviewing the merits of administrative decisions made by the Department, including visa cancellation decisions.

If you believe the decision to refuse or cancel your visa had a legal error, you may be able to seek judicial review of the decision through the Australian court system.

You cannot appeal a decision that was made by the Minister personally, except by seeking judicial review.

Appeals have strict time limits. You must apply in writing within the time specified by us in the decision notification letter.

Learn more about the Administrative Review Tribunal and how to apply.

Getting help

You may wish to seek assistance with your immigration status from a registered migration agent, or seek independent legal advice.

### Character caseload prioritisation and processing times
Processing priorities

We aim to finalise cases as soon as possible. We consider the particular circumstances of each case to determine the priority we should give the case.

We give priority processing to the following cases:

visa applicants who are located in immigration detention facilities in Australia

cases that have extremely sensitive and/or compelling and compassionate circumstances.

We only consider applications that show the most compelling needs for prioritisation ahead of other cases.

We recommend that offshore visa applicants do not finalise travel plans until they know the outcome of their character assessment. We will not prioritise a case because you have made travel arrangements.

Processing times

Cases referred for character consideration typically involve a range of complex and sensitive matters. They can take significant time to finalise. Processing times can vary for a range of reasons, including:

the nature of the conduct engaged in or crimes committed

the complexity of the circumstances of your case

how long it takes us to perform the required checks

how quickly you respond to requests for more information

how long it takes to receive information from law enforcement and other government agencies in relation to character requirements.
