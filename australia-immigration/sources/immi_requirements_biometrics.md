### Provide biometrics
Biometrics

The Migration Act 1958 and the Migration Regulations 1994 may require you to provide personal identifiers as part of the application process. ‘ Personal identifiers ’ is a term used in the Migration Act 1958 and the Migration Regulations 1994 and can include your fingerprints and an image of your face and shoulders.

These are also known as ‘ biometrics ’ features of your body that can be used to identify you.

We will tell you if you need to provide biometrics:

If you apply for a visa that is part of the biometrics program .

If you apply for a visa from a country or jurisdiction that is part of our biometrics program .

You can submit your visa application online or by post. If we send you a letter asking for your biometrics, you must either attend the ABCC (Australian Biometrics Collection Centre) in person or, if eligible, providing them using use the Australian Immi App.

For more information about the Australian Immi App, including eligibility, see Australian Immi App .

How to arrange an appointment

VFS Global is contracted by the department to provide biometric collection services.

These services have a fee in addition to the visa application charge.

ABCCs are in 50 countries globally. You may need to travel to another country to attend an ABCC. A full list of ABCC locations can be found below.

If you are located in Pakistan or Iran, please visit your nearest ABCC at a time that is convenient for you. For all other locations, you must arrange an appointment first.

To book an appointment to have your biometrics collected for your Australian visa, go to VFS Global .

VFS Global do not answer pre-lodgement or post-lodgement enquiries.

Applicants within Australia

We will tell you if you need to provide biometrics.

You will then need to advise the relevant office to let them know that you are onshore so that they can arrange the collection of your biometrics in Australia. See processing offices and locations.
### What we collect
We will:

take a photo of your face with a digital camera

scan all 10 of your fingertips with a digital finger scanner.

Applicants must have a parent or guardian with them if they are:

deemed a minor under the laws of the country where the biometrics are collected

incapable of understanding biometrics collection.

For applicants outside of Australia we don't collect fingerprints of children aged under 5. We only take their photograph.

For applicants within Australia, we don't collect fingerprints of children aged under 10. We only take their photograph.

If you have temporary injuries to your face or fingerprints, if possible wait until they have healed before providing your biometrics.

If you are missing a finger, we will collect fingerprints of your remaining fingers.

Contact your ABCC to find out if you can still give fingerprints if you have a mehndi or other temporary decoration of your hands or fingers.

If you wear glasses or a religious head covering, we will still collect your photo.

Your face must be clearly visible from the bottom of your chin to above your eyebrows, including both cheeks and both ears. You might have to remove your head covering or glasses. If you do:

your photo and fingerprints will be collected in private

you can ask to have them collected by someone of the same gender.
