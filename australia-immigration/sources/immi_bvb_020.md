Help with your visa

If you are getting help with your visa, before you pay someone, read information on Who can help with your visa application .

## About this visa
### About this visa
This is a temporary visa. The BVB travel facility may be granted with single or multiple travel and will be valid for use until a specified date. If the travel facility has ended or does not have sufficient validity remaining to cover your proposed journey, then you will need to apply for and be granted a new BVB prior to leaving Australia. Check if you already hold a Bridging visa B (BVB) with VEVO .

A separate application for a BVB may be necessary where you have applied for judicial review. It is not possible to apply to change conditions on your BVB. If you want to change visa conditions, then you will need to consider applying for a Bridging visa A (BVA).

You can’t use a bridging visa while you wait for a citizenship application to be decided.
### In effect
A BVB comes into effect when:

it is granted (if your substantive visa has ceased since applying for the BVB or where the BVB is more beneficial than your current bridging visa)

your current substantive visa ceases.

Visa holders must adhere to the conditions imposed on their visa. Where you are granted a BVB, you will be notified about the conditions that apply.

If you hold a substantive visa when your BVB is granted, you must continue to comply with the conditions of the substantive visa. When your substantive visa ceases, the conditions of your BVB will apply.
### Working in Australia
You might be allowed to work if the substantive visa you had or the visa you applied for lets you work. Your grant letter will tell you about the conditions that apply to your BVB.

If the visa you had, and the visa you applied for have work restrictions you will not be able to work with a BVB. See if you have work restrictions in VEVO .

If you are the holder of a BVB that does not permit work, and you are seeking to change conditions, you will need to consider applying for a BVA . As part of this process you will need to demonstrate that you are in financial hardship.
### Remaining lawful during judicial review
If a merits review tribunal upholds our decision to refuse your substantive visa application and you apply for judicial review, you will need to apply for a bridging visa to maintain your lawful status during the judicial review proceedings. If you have applied for judicial review you can only apply for a bridging visa by webform.
### With this visa you can
Stay lawfully in Australia until your substantive visa application is finally determined, or if granted in association with judicial proceedings, until those proceedings are complete.

Leave and return to Australia within the defined travel period while your application for a substantive visa is being processed.
### How long you can stay
One of the following outcomes will determine when your BVB ceases:

your substantive visa application is refused

your merits or judicial review is decided

you withdraw your application for the substantive visa, merits review or judicial review

a merits review tribunal tells you that it has no jurisdiction to consider your application for review

we grant you the substantive visa that the BVB is associated with

we cancel your BVB or the substantive visa that you held when you were granted a BVB.

Once you have been notified of an outcome you can see exactly how long you can stay in Australia in VEVO .

BVB granted on or after 19 November 2016

Your BVB will end 35 calendar days after:

our refusal decision or a decision by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) in relation to your associated substantive visa application

a determination that your substantive visa application or an application for review by the AAT is invalid

you withdraw your substantive visa application or application for review by the AAT.

You BVB will end 28 calendar days after:

a judicial review body upholds the decision to refuse your substantive visa application

you withdraw a related judicial review application.

BVB granted before 19 November 2016

Your BVB will end 28 days after the date that one of the following happens:

we notify you that your substantive visa application is not valid

we notify you that your substantive visa application has been refused

you withdraw your substantive visa application

a merits review tribunal notifies you that it has upheld our decision to refuse your substantive visa application

a merit review tribunal notifies you that it has no jurisdiction to consider your application for review

you withdraw your application for merits or judicial review from a merits review tribunal or a judicial review body

a judicial review body upholds the decision to refuse your substantive visa application.
### Stay longer
You can’t stay in Australia longer by extending this visa. You must apply for a new visa if you wish to stay longer. Explore your visa options .
### Include family
If you and your family have applied together for a substantive visa in Australia, you can include them in your BVB application providing they are members of the family unit . This means you and your family have to complete only one application form and pay one visa application charge. But, each member of the family will have to meet the requirements for a BVB in their own right.

Only those family members who have substantial reasons for needing to travel outside Australia should be included in your BVB application. If some of your family members do not need to travel outside Australia, they can stay in Australia on their current bridging visas.
### Cost
### Apply from
You and anyone included in your BVB application must be in Australia to make a valid application and to be granted the visa.
### Your obligations
You and anyone included in your application must:

comply with all Australian laws

comply with the conditions of the current visa

comply with the conditions of the your BVB when it comes in to effect

You can find your visa conditions in your grant letter or VEVO .

Working

We will let you know which conditions apply to your BVB if we grant the visa.
### Travel
When we grant your BVB, we will tell you when the specified travel period will end.

If you hold a BVB where the specified travel period has ended but you need to travel outside Australia again, you will have to apply for another BVB and be granted this visa before leaving Australia.

If you are outside Australia when the specified travel period on your BVB ends, the visa will cease. You can't return to Australia with a ceased BVB.
### Visa label
We will digitally link your visa to your passport. You will not get a label in your passport.

## Eligibility（節錄）
- Have had a substantive visa
- Hold a BVA or a BVB
- Have applied for substantive visa or judicial review
  You must have made a valid application for a substantive visa and either:

that application has not been finally determined, or

that application was refused and you have made an application for judicial review (within the prescribed timeframe), and the judicial review proceedings have not been completed.
- When applying for a review, have applied in the prescribed timeframe
  You must apply for review within the prescribed timeframes.

Administrative Appeals Tribunal

You must apply for review within the prescribed timeframe.

If you have applied within the prescribed timeframe you may not need to apply for a further bridging visa.

Judicial review

The timeframe for applying for judicial review is 35 days from the date of the Tribunal's decision.

If you have not applied for judicial review within the statutory timeframes, this may affect your eligibility to apply for a further bridging visa.
- Have substantial reasons for wanting to travel
- Age
- Meet character requirement

## Step guide（節錄）
- Step 1 - Before you apply
  Check whether you hold a BVA or BVB in VEVO . Check your passport is valid. You should apply for your BVB no more than 3 months, and not less than 2 weeks, before the date on which you want to travel.
  New step description
    Usually, you must have a valid passport for us to grant you this visa. If you plan to get a new passport, you should do so before applying for your visa.

If you need to apply for a BVB, you can either apply for the visa online, or by post or courier. How you apply depends on how you applied for your associated substantive visa.

If you applied for your substantive visa online in ImmiAccount, you must apply for a BVB in ImmiAccount.

If you made an application for merits or judicial review, you must apply on paper.
  - When to apply
    You should apply for your BVB no more than 3 months, and not less than 2 weeks, before the date on which you want to travel.

Some visas can only be granted while you are in Australia. If you apply for a BVB too far in advance of your travel, it could be difficult for us to assess whether your substantive visa will be ready for decision. To be granted a BVB, you must be in Australia when the decision is made on the application.

If you leave it until the last minute to apply for a BVB you risk not being granted a BVB before you are due to leave Australia. If this happens, you might not hold a visa that allows you to return to Australia.

You would then have to apply for and be granted a substantive visa before you could return to Australia and there is no guarantee that you would be granted a visa.
  - Get help with your application
    Only some people can help you with your application. If you appoint someone to give you immigration assistance they must be:
