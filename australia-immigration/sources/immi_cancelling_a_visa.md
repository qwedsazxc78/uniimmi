### Overview
Only the Minister or a delegate of the Minister can:

grant

refuse or

cancel a visa.

Cancellation of a visa can be:

discretionary

mandatory or

by operation of law.

In some circumstances, you can ask us to cancel your visa.

If we cancel your visa, we may also cancel the visas held by any of your family members.

A person with parental responsibility can ask us to cancel the visa of a person under 18 years old.

You, your employer, your sponsor or a family have an obligation to tell the Department about any change in your circumstances.

Your employer, a sponsor or family member cannot cancel your visa. To find out more about your rights at work visit Workers’ rights and visa reporting protections .

Cancellation of your visa might affect any future visa applications that you make. It may prevent you from being granted certain visas to travel to, enter or stay in Australia.
### Reasons why we may cancel your visa
The Migration Act 1958 gives reasons for why we may cancel your visa. The below list is not exhaustive.

We may cancel your visa if you:

do not comply with visa conditions

provide us with incorrect or fraudulent information or fake documents or your circumstances have changed since the visa was granted

could be a risk to the Australian community

have been charged or convicted of an offence

did not otherwise meet our character requirements .

If you are in Australia or going through immigration clearance, we will usually tell you of our intention to consider cancelling your visa. We will give you the opportunity to put forward reasons why we should not cancel your visa.

View the Migration Act 1958 .
### Cancellation or refusal of a visa under character provisions
If you do not meet character requirements, the Minister (or delegate) can refuse your visa application or cancel your visa.

For more information on cancellations or refusals under the character provisions, visit Character requirements for visas .
### Cancellation of a visa under other provisions
Paying for sponsorship

We may cancel your visa if you are involved in paying for visa sponsorship.

We consider all circumstances before we make a decision. This includes:

if you initiated or were complicit in the paying for sponsorship

you have cooperated with us and provided information.

We may not cancel a visa if you are the victim of:

exploitation

human trafficking or

slavery.

You should give us all relevant information if that is the case.

You will have a chance to put forward reasons why we should not cancel your visa. You should include evidence showing:

the strength of your ties to Australia

your contribution to the Australian community.

Non-compliance with a work related visa condition

We may cancel your visa if you have not complied with a work related visa condition. Check your visa conditions in Visa Entitlement Verification Online (VEVO) .

When determining whether to cancel your visa, the Minister (or delegate) will consider all relevant circumstances. This includes circumstances in which the ground for cancellation arose.

We may not cancel your visa if there is evidence that you have been subject to workplace exploitation. If that is the case, you will need to give us all relevant information about exploitation that is evidenced by the relevant certification. For more information about workplace exploitation, see Workers rights and visa protections.

Changes to study

We may cancel your student visa if you are no longer enrolled in a registered course.

Your enrolment ends when you complete the course. This can be earlier than the end date on your Confirmation of Enrolment.

What you must do after you complete your course depends on your enrolment arrangement.

When you complete the course for which your student visa was granted, you will have 3 months to depart Australia or apply for another visa.

We may cancel your visa if you:

complete the course for which we granted your student visa, and you do not leave Australia or apply for a new visa within 3 months

change courses since grant of your student visa and your new Confirmation of Enrolment for your principal course has an earlier end date, and you do not leave Australia or apply for a new visa within 28 days of completing the course

are studying more than one course on your visa (course packaging) and you finish a course early and have a gap between courses of more than 2 months (except if this gap occurs between the end of an academic year and the beginning of a new academic year).

Before we cancel your student visa, we will consider your situation. This includes if:

you legitimately finish the course early

you have a good academic record

it is reasonable to expect you to enrol in another course during the course gap.

We might also cancel your visa if you do not comply with any of your other student visa conditions. Check your visa conditions in Visa Entitlement Verification Online (VEVO) .

Biosecurity contraventions

It is important to declare certain food, plant material and animal items from overseas as these items may:

introduce serious pests and diseases into Australia

devastate our valuable agriculture and tourism industries and our unique environment.

The Minister (or delegate) has the power to cancel some visitor, student and work visas in immigration clearance if you:

do not meet the requirements to answer questions about goods on your incoming passenger card

do not follow directions given by a biosecurity officer about goods or baggage

provide false or misleading information or documents to a biosecurity officer.

For more information about Australia’s Biosecurity laws visit the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry .

Importation of objectionable goods

The Minister (or delegate) has the power to cancel a temporary visa if you import objectionable goods and materials without permission.

Objectionable goods include material that describes, depicts, expresses or otherwise deals with matters of:

sex

drug misuse or addiction

crime

cruelty

violence

revolting or abhorrent phenomena in a way that would offend a reasonable adult.

It also includes goods that depict children under 18 years of age in a way that would:

offend a reasonable adult

promote crime or violence

promote drug misuse

advocate the doing of a terrorist act.

For more information about prohibited goods and materials, see List of prohibited items

Criminal Justice Entry visas

If you have a Criminal Justice Entry visa, or you stayed in Australia after we cancelled your Criminal Justice Entry visa, the only visa you can apply for is a Protection visa.
### Request a visa cancellation
If you are outside Australia, we can process requests for the voluntary cancellation of your visa.

We will not process requests for cancellation of the following visas:

Visitor (subclass 600)

Electronic Travel Authority (subclass 601)

eVisitor (subclass 651)

Working Holiday visa (subclass 417)

any permanent visa

any other visa with less than 6 months validity.

Only the visa holder or an authorised agent can request a cancellation. You should do this through ImmiAccount .

You can access your superannuation once we have cancelled your visa, or after it has expired. You can find more information at Access your super .

Temporary Sponsored Work Visa Holders

To make a claim for your superannuation, you need to request cancellation of your visa if you:

hold a temporary sponsored work visa with more than 6 months validity

have ceased employment

have departed Australia.

Business Sponsors

Business sponsors must tell the Department that a visa holder has ceased employment using the ‘Notification of Sponsor Changes’ in ImmiAccount .

You can access this form through a link in your original sponsorship application. For more instructions see Notification of Sponsorship Changes.

Waiting for outcome of application

If you applied for another visa in Australia, we may have granted you Bridging visa in association with that visa application.

The bridging visa comes into effect when your current visa ceases. You need to comply with the conditions of your current visa until the bridging visa comes into effect. If we cancel your current visa your Bridging Visa will cease at the same time.

If we cancel your visa, you may be eligible for a Bridging Visa E . This will allow you to stay lawfully in Australia.

The cancellation will impose an application bar, which means you may only apply for particular visas while in Australia. This will not affect your current visa application. However, you will have limited visa options if your current visa application is not granted and you wish to lodge a further visa application while in Australia.

If you do not have a valid visa, contact the Department's Immigration Status Resolution Service (SRS) .
### Consequences of visa refusal or cancellation
Detention and removal

If we cancel or refuse your visa on character grounds you may have a limited time to depart Australia or no longer hold a valid visa.

If you are in Australia without a valid visa, you could face serious consequences including immigration detention and removal from Australia.

Learn what to do if you do not have a valid visa.

If you do not have a valid visa, contact the Department's Immigration Status Resolution Service (SRS) .

Restrictions on re-entering Australia

If we have cancelled your visa you may have a re-entry ban and can only be granted another visa in limited circumstances. Learn more about re-entry bans.

Restrictions on visa applications

If you have had a visa refused or cancelled there may be limitations on the type of visa you can apply for while you are still in Australia.

Family may be cancelled

We may also cancel the visas of any family members, children or other persons who held visas connected to your visa.
### Appeal a cancellation
If we refuse or cancel your visa on character grounds, we will let you know in writing. We will tell you why we refused or cancelled your visa and if you have a right to a review of the decision.

The independent Administrative Review Tribunal (ART) is responsible for reviewing the merits of administrative decisions made by the Department, including visa cancellation decisions.

If you believe the decision to refuse or cancel your visa had a legal error, you may be able to seek judicial review of the decision through the Australian court system.

You cannot appeal a decision that was made by the Minister personally, except by seeking judicial review.

Appeals have strict time limits. You must apply in writing within the time specified by us in the decision notification letter.

Learn more about the Administrative Review Tribunal and how to apply.
### Getting help
You may wish to seek assistance with your immigration status from a registered migration agent, or seek independent legal advice.
