Help with your visa

If you are getting help with your visa, before you pay someone, read information on who can help with your visa application .

Cost: From AUD48,640.00 over 2 instalments for a single applicant.

## About this visa
### With this visa you can

work and study in Australia

enrol in Australia's public healthcare scheme, Medicare

sponsor your family members to come to Australia

travel to and from Australia for 5 years

attend free English language classes provided by the Adult Migrant English Program , if eligible

if eligible, apply for Australian citizenship .

Travel to and from Australia for 5 years

You can travel to and from Australia as many times as you want for 5 years from the date we grant this visa. This is as long as the travel facility on this visa remains valid.

If you want to travel after the initial 5-year travel facility:

to re-enter Australia as a permanent resident you will need to apply for and be granted a Resident Return (RRV)

you might also want to consider Australian citizenship. If you become an Australian citizen, you don't require a visa to enter Australia. You will need to apply for an Australian passport and use it to leave and re-enter Australia.

See more about eligibility requirements and current processing times for becoming a citizen .

To see when your travel facility ends, use VEVO .

If you hold a Contributory Parent (Temporary) (subclass 173) visa

You can apply for the subclass 143 visa as a 2-step process by first applying for a Contributory Parent (Temporary) (subclass 173) visa. Applying for the subclass 173 visa and then the subclass 143 visa allows you to spread the cost of the visas over a number of years.

You have already met the balance of family test.

If you apply for a Parent visa (subclass 143) as a retiree

If you apply for the subclass 143 visa as a retiree you don't have to:

meet the balance of family test, or

have a sponsor or an assurance of support
### How long you can stay
This is a permanent visa. It lets you stay in Australia indefinitely.

For citizenship purposes, your permanent residency starts on the day:

we grant the visa if you are in Australia

you enter Australia on this visa if you are outside Australia
### Include family
You can include members of the family unit in your application when you apply.

You are required to include details of all your family members in your application form, whether they are migrating or not.

Family members who apply for the visa must meet our health and character requirements. Family members who are not coming to Australia might also have to meet our health and character requirements.

You pay for this visa in 2 parts, called instalments.

Pay the first instalment when you apply. Pay the second instalment when we ask you to.

You might also have to pay other costs for each applicant for health checks, police certificates and biometrics . For more information see Fees and charges for other services .

See more about visa fees and charges .
### Apply from
You can be in or outside Australia when you apply for the visa.

If you apply in Australia, any family members who apply with you must also be in Australia, but not in immigration clearance, when you apply. If you apply outside Australia, any family members who apply for the visa with you must also be outside Australia when you apply.

If you are applying as a retiree you must be in Australia, but not in immigration clearance, when you apply. You can be in or outside Australia when we make a decision on your application
### Processing times
The demand for Parent visas is greater than the number of places available each year. As a result, processing times for these applications are lengthy.

Applications for this visa are subject to capping and queueing and are processed in the order we receive them.

For an indication of processing times for this visa, visit Parent visa queue release dates .

For more information on priorities visit Family visa processing priorities .

Your application might take longer to process if:

you don't fill it in correctly

you don't include all of the documents we need or we need more information from you and/or

your information takes a long time to verify.

We can't process your application if you don't pay the correct visa application charge. We will notify you if this is the case and if necessary return your application.

For further information on Migration Program outcomes against planning for each migration program year, read the Reports on Migration Programs .

Assessment

We assess applications for this visa in 2 stages:

An initial assessment to check eligibility and either add the application to the queue or refuse it.

As places become available, applications are released from the queue for final assessment.

Do not arrange to stay permanently in Australia until your visa is granted. We will let you know in writing if we grant you the visa.

Consider another visa

Other Parent visas available include the:

Contributory Parent (Temporary) visa (subclass 173) .

Followed by a permanent Contributory Parent visa (subclass 143) .

This 2-step visa process is faster but costs more than the Parent visa (subclass 103). It also costs more than applying directly for the Contributory Parent visa (subclass 143), but the cost is spread across the 2 visas over a longer period.

Sponsored Parent (Temporary) visa (subclass 870) .

This is a temporary visa allowing parents to visit their children in Australia for up to 3 or 5 years at a time and a cumulative maximum 10 year period.

You can view all visa options on our Visa list page .
### Your obligations
You must enter Australia before the date specified in your grant letter.

You and your family members must meet all visa conditions and obey Australian laws.

See what conditions might be attached to this visa on our visa conditions page .
### Visa label
We will digitally link your visa to your passport. You will not get a label in your passport.
