## About this visa
### With this visa the child can
stay in Australia indefinitely

work and study in Australia

enrol in Australia's public healthcare scheme, Medicare

sponsor relatives to come to Australia

attend free English language classes provided by the Adult Migrant English Program , if eligible

apply for Australian citizenship , if eligible.

Travel to and from Australia for 5 years

The child can travel to and from Australia as many times as they want for 5 years from the date we grant this visa. This is as long as the travel facility of this visa remains valid.

If the child wants to travel after the initial 5-year travel facility:

they will need to apply for and be granted a Resident Return (RRV) visa so they can re-enter Australia as a permanent resident

they might also want to consider Australian citizenship. If they become an Australian citizen, they don't require a visa to re-enter Australia. See more about eligibility requirements and current processing times for Australian citizenship

To see when the child's travel facility ends, use VEVO .
### How long the child can stay
This is a permanent visa. It lets the child stay in Australia indefinitely.

The child becomes a permanent resident the day we grant the visa.
### Include other children
If the child has siblings who also want to apply, submit separate applications for each sibling.

The child's dependent children can be included on their application when they apply or at any time before we decide the application.

Dependent children of the child who apply for the visa must meet our health requirement .

Family members who are not coming to Australia might also have to meet our health requirement.
### Cost
The visa costs for the main applicant.

There is also a charge for each dependent child who applies for the visa with you.

There might be other costs for health exams , police certificates and biometrics .

To work out what your visa will cost, use the Visa Pricing Estimator . The estimator does not take into account the other costs.
### Apply from
The child must be in Australia, but not in immigration clearance , when the application is submitted and when we make a decision.

The child can't apply for this visa if they are in Australia on another visa with a no further stay condition.
### Processing times
For an indication of processing times for this visa, use the visa processing time guide tool . This will show the processing times for recently decided applications. It is a guide only and not specific to your application.

The application might take longer to process if:

it is not filled in correctly

it does not include all required documents or we need more information

it takes us time to verify your information

you do not make full payment at the time of initial lodgement.

We cannot process the application if you do not pay the correct visa application charge. If this happens, we will let you know and may return your application.

You should receive an acknowledgement of your application (and advice of any associated bridging visa) within approximately one (1) month after lodgement.

We will contact you using your authorised method if we need more information. Otherwise, we will contact you with the outcome of your application.
### The child's obligations
The child and any dependants must obey all Australian laws.
### Visa label
We will digitally link the visa to the child's passport. They will not get a label in their passport.

A child does not meet the dependency requirement, if the stepparent is the current spouse or de facto partner of the child’s biological or adopted parent.

Adopted children

To be eligible for this visa, the adoption must have been finalised before the child turned 18.

if no Australian state or territory central authority was involved, through an expatriate adoption by an Australian citizen, an eligible New Zealand citizen or the holder of an Australian permanent visa who has been living outside Australia for more than 12 months before the adoption was finalised

Learn more about adopting a child overseas from Intercountry Adoptions Australia .​​

It is recommended that you obtain independent legal advice both in Australia and in the child’s country of usual residence before proceeding with an expatriate adoption as there are risks for both the child and the adoptive parents in this process.

be the child of their step-parent’s former partner

be aged under 18.

The step-parent must also have either:

the child was born outside Australia

one of their parents was an Australian citizen at the time of their child’s birth.
- Have a sponsor
  The child must be sponsored by an eligible parent or their parent's spouse or de facto partner.

We must approve the sponsorship before the visa can be granted.

If the sponsor and/or their spouse or de facto partner (if any) have a pending registrable offence charge, we will refuse the sponsorship and visa application.

If the sponsor and/or their spouse or de facto partner (if any) have a registrable offence conviction, we can only approve the sponsorship in very limited circumstances.
