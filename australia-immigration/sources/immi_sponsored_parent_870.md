You can apply to stay in Australia for up to 3 or 5 years at a time, with a cumulative maximum stay of 10 years.

If you held a Sponsored Parent (Temporary) visa and were outside Australia on 1 July 2021, your visa period was automatically extended by 18 months under the COVID-19 visa concessions . If your visa was extended under this concession, the additional 18 months will not count towards your cumulative 10 year maximum stay.

### Stay longer
You cannot stay in Australia longer by extending this visa. If you wish to remain in Australia, you must apply for and be granted another visa.
### Applying for another Sponsored Parent (Temporary) visa
If you are applying for another Sponsored Parent (Temporary) visa, you must lodge your application from outside of Australia. This applies unless we have issued you with Permission to Apply in Australia (but not in immigration clearance).

If you apply for another Sponsored Parent (Temporary) visa whilst outside of Australia, you will not be eligible for the grant of this visa unless you have been outside of Australia for at least 90 consecutive days since your relevant departure day.

You can calculate your relevant departure day based on your location when your last Sponsored Parent (Temporary) visa ceased:

If you were in Australia – your relevant departure day is the first day you left Australia after your visa ceased.

If you were outside of Australia - your relevant departure day is the last day you left Australia while the visa was in effect.
