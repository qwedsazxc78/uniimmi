​​​​​​​​​​

We may ask you to have health examinations. If we do, we will give you:

a list of the examinations you must have

an identifier we call a HAP ID.​

You will need the HAP ID to make an appointment for your health examinations.​

If you are unable to undergo the health examination within the timeframe requested in your Request for Health Examination letter, you should notify the Department by attaching details through your ImmiAccount.

If you have not yet lodged a visa application and intend to complete your health examinations upfront prior to submitting your visa application, you might be able to use the My Health Declarations service to obtain a HAP ID. See When to have health examinations .

To organise your health examinations upfront, refer to ​ Organising my health examinations upfront​ . ​

In Australia​

Arrange your health examinations with our migration medical services provider, Bupa Medical Visa Services.

Book your examinations online at Bupa Medical Visa Services .

If you have an appointment that you are unable to attend, it is very important that you cancel or change your booking as soon as possible through Bupa's online booking system​ .

You can cancel or change your appointment by selecting Modify/Cancel Booking or by calling Bupa's Contact Centre on 1300 794 919. You will require the HAP ID you used to make the appointment to make changes to a booking.​

Call 1300 794 919 to arrange your health examinations if:

you do not have internet access, or

you need to arrange a Carer visa assessment, or

you need to arrange a fitness to depart or travel assessment

Outside Australia

You must be examined by one of the Department’s approved panel physicians or clinics.

A panel physician is a doctor or radiologist appointed by the department to do health examinations outside Australia at an approved clinic.

For information on how to contact a panel physician, find a panel physician nearest to you.
