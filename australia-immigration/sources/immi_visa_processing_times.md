We aim to improve processing times while maintaining program integrity.

Variations in processing times

Processing times vary for many reasons, including:

If applications have all necessary supporting documents.

If applications are lodged online or as a paper applications – applying online helps streamline processing.

How quickly responses for further information are provided.

How long it takes to receive information from external agencies, particularly relating to health, character and national security requirements.

For permanent visa applications, the number of places available in the migration program.

The complexity of a visa application.

The number of visa applications increases or decreases.

Changes to Ministerial Directions.

Deciding older applications increases processing times.

Median processing times for key programs

The information below shows the median visa processing times for key visa categories. This is the most accurate way to show the amount of time it is taking most visa applications to be finalised.

Visa processing times vary between different visas within these categories, and in some cases it may take longer for those visas to be finalised.

We are focused on reducing processing times for all skilled (temporary) visas. Incomplete applications, where we need to request further information, delays the processing of applications. For tips on lodging a complete application, see Sponsored skilled visa tips and Check twice, submit once . Where possible, we also encourage the simultaneous lodgement of nomination and visa applications which results in more efficient processing. We are also focussed on deciding older and complex applications. This focus will affect the overall monthly program processing time.

Student visa applications lodged outside Australia are processed in accordance with a Ministerial Direction. Applications lodged before 14 November 2025 are processed according to Ministerial Direction 111 , and applications lodged on or after 14 November 2025 are processed according to Ministerial Direction 115 .

Information on processing times for visas is updated regularly as new data is available.

Processing times are available for most visas, except:

visas that are closed to new applications

visas that have too few decisions in the month to provide a reliable indicator of processing times.
