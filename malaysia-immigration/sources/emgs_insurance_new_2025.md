# Insurance - New

It is compulsory for every student entering Malaysia to have a medical insurance. All international students must be covered by a locally purchased medical health insurance scheme. You will be insured from the date you enter Malaysia if you inform your institution of the date as soon as you arrive.

An international student, through his/her educational institution, can opt to either one of the following Medical Insurances offered by:
- Etiqa Family Takaful Berhad (EFTB)
- Great Eastern Takaful Berhad (GETB)
- The Pacific Insurance Berhad (TPIB)

The insurance package provided meets the minimum coverage requirements set out by the Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE).

**Example 1: Hospitalisation expenses**
- Assumed eligible hospitalisation expenses = RM8,500.00
- Deductible amount per disability = RM25.00
- Amount to be paid by you = RM25.00
- Amount to be paid by Insurer = RM8,475.00

**Example 2: Outpatient expenses**
- Assumed eligible outpatient expenses = RM100.00
- Deductible amount per outpatient visit = RM25.00
- Amount to be paid by you = RM25.00
- Amount to be paid by Insurer = RM75.00

## EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS

Education institutions in Malaysia are permitted to organize directly/indirectly with insurance companies to offer Medical and Health Insurance to international students, provided such Medical Insurance meets the requirements set out by the MOHE.

## INSURANCE TOP-UP

Students are reminded that it is compulsory for them to have a valid medical insurance plan throughout the period of study. Students whose insurance cover period expires prior to the expiry of their existing student pass are required to top up/extend their insurance.
