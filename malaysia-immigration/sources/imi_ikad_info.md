# i-KAD (Expatriate Identity Card)

The i-KAD is a biometric residence permit issued by the Immigration Department of Malaysia to eligible foreign nationals. It serves as an official identity document within Malaysia, but it is **not** a substitute for a passport, especially for travel.

### Key Information

- **Reinstatement:** The issuance of the i-KAD for expatriates was reinstated in late 2023 (effective 16 Oct 2023 for MDEC, and 24 Oct 2023 for ESD).

- **Purpose:** To serve as a valid ID card for expatriates, reducing the need to carry a passport for day-to-day activities within Malaysia (e.g., opening a bank account). However, the passport must still be carried for travel.

---

### Eligibility

The i-KAD is issued to foreign nationals holding specific long-term passes, including:
- **Employment Pass (EP)** - Categories I, II, and III.
- **Residence Pass-Talent (RP-T)**.
- **Dependents** of the passes listed above.

The pass must have a validity of **more than six (6) months** to be eligible for an i-KAD.

### Issuance and Collection

- **Automatic Process:** For new and renewal applications processed through ESD or MDEC after the reinstatement dates, the i-KAD is issued automatically upon the successful endorsement of the primary pass (e.g., Employment Pass).
- **Collection:** The i-KAD is typically collected along with the passport after endorsement at the relevant centre (e.g., MYXpats Centre).

---

### Important Rules

- **Return Upon Cancellation:** The i-KAD card **must be returned** to the Immigration Department of Malaysia when the holder's long-term pass is cancelled or shortened.
- **No Replacement for Loss:** According to official announcements, there is **no replacement** for a lost or stolen i-KAD. A new card is only issued upon the next renewal of the primary pass.
