## ANNOUNCEMENT ON NEW VDR ISSUANCE PROCEDURES
15 June 2015
MYXpats Centre is pleased to announce new procedures that will streamline and improve the application process for a Visa With Reference letter, or Visa Dengan Rujukan (VDR), for expatriates and their dependants. These new procedures will come into effect on1 July 2015.
Under the new enhanced procedures, an online VDR letter will be digitally generated through the ESD's online system without requiring the signature of an Immigration Officer. The VDR letter can then be emailed to the applicant in his or her home country, where the applicant can then proceed to apply for the Single Entry Visa (SEV) at the respective Malaysian Embassy/Consulate General/High Commission Office.
This improved issuance process for VDR letters will do away with the need for companies to physically collect the VDR letter from either MYXpats Centre in the Klang Valley or the ESD office in Putrajaya. It will also greatly reduce the waiting time before an applicant receives the VDR letter, improving the quality and efficiency of expatriate services delivery.
The new digitally generated VDR letter, which will only be available to companies who have successfully registered with ESD, will apply to company applications submitted on 1 July onwards.
ESD-registered companies who have submitted their applications for the VDR letterpriorto 1 July will still be issued with a physical VDR letter which will need to be collected from the ESD office in Putrajaya under the current procedures.
Should you have any queries concerning the new procedures for VDR letters, please contact MYXpats Centre at (Tel) 03 - 8892 3939 or (Email) MYXpats@talentcorp.com.my.
