# Medical Screening
Malaysia has a good healthcare system with a combination of public and private clinics and hospitals. In many of its towns and cities there are also a wide range of alternative treatments available; including osteopathy, naturopathy, homeopathy, Chinese medicine, chiropractic treatments as well as acupuncture.
Usually, there are costs involved when international students require health services. However, since medical insurance is compulsory for foreign students, you will be covered if you visit a clinic or hospital that is listed on your insurance plan. Most university campuses also have a student health centre that will treat you for common ailments.
New international students are mandated to undergo the following medical screenings in accordance with the requirements of the Malaysian Ministry of Education. In addition, the medical screening results shall be certified in accordance with the medical screening guidelines set by the Ministry.

## Post-Arrival/In-Country Medical Screening

(a) New International Students

New international students are required to attend a medical screening at a panel clinic in Malaysia within 7 working days of their arrival date.

IMPORTANT:
EMGS will not be able to initiate the process of student pass endorsement and supporting letter issuance for sticker endorsement purposes in the event that the international students fail to undergo the in-country screening.

(b) International Students applying for pass Renewal

International students who are renewing their student passes are not required to attend in-country medical screening

(c) International Students applying for Variation or Progression
