The existing expatriate salary policy, which was based on the decision of the Economic Council meeting dated 20 December 2016, has been further strengthened through a series of structured engagements with industry players and relevant stakeholders since 2022. The revised policy aligns with the objectives of theThirteenth Malaysia Plan (RMK-13)to reduce reliance on foreign labour and to prioritise the employment of suitably qualified local talent.
Under this policy, the minimum salary thresholds forEmployment Pass (EP) Categories I, II, and IIIhave been revised, and a structured employment duration framework has been introduced. These measures aim to support sustainable economic growth while strengthening the development of local talents.Revised Employment Pass Salary Thresholds

In preparation for the full implementation of this policy, MOHA will conduct engagement and consultation sessions with relevant stakeholders, including industry players, employers, and related agencies. These sessions aim to provide clarity on policy requirements and implementation mechanisms, ensuring a smooth, transparent, and orderly transition that does not disrupt business continuity.
In line with the principles ofMalaysia MADANI, the Government remains committed to ensuring that all policy enhancements are implemented in a gradual, balanced, and inclusive manner, while prioritising national interests, promoting sustainable economic growth, and fostering the long-term development of local human capital.
