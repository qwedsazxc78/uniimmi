 Purpose 

 The &ldquo;Immigration Facilitation Scheme for Visitors Participating in Short-term Activities in Designated Sectors&rdquo; (&ldquo; the STV Scheme &rdquo;) is implemented with effect from 1 June 2024. It aims to provide immigration facilitation to visitors invited/sponsored by authorised host organisations (&ldquo; eligible visitors &rdquo;) for undertaking specified short-term activities which are beneficial to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (&ldquo; HKSAR &rdquo;). Following a review, the scope of facilitation under the STV Scheme will be further expanded with effect from 1 November 2025 to facilitate more eligible visitors to come to Hong Kong to participate in specified short-term activities.

 General 

 Regulation 2(1) of the Immigration Regulations (Chapter 115A), Laws of Hong Kong, stipulates that permission given to a person to land in Hong Kong as a visitor shall be subject to the following conditions of stay:

 he shall not take any employment, whether paid or unpaid;

 he shall not establish or join in any business; and

 he shall not become a student at a school, university or other educational institution.

 Any person who contravenes a condition of stay in force in respect of him shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a maximum fine of HK$50,000 and to imprisonment for 2 years under section 41 of the Immigration Ordinance (Chapter 115), Laws of Hong Kong.

 The Facilitation under the STV Scheme 

 Under the STV Scheme, eligible visitors will not need to apply for an employment visa / entry permit to undertake the specified short-term activities in the HKSAR. The duration of participation in the specified short-term activities is up to 14 consecutive calendar days , counting from the day when the eligible visitors start to participate in such activities, for each period of permitted stay as visitor (i.e. upon each arrival in the HKSAR). There is no cap on the number of designated short-term activities the eligible visitors may participate in during that 14-day period.

 Specified Short-term Activities in 17 Designated Sectors 

 The STV Scheme covers 17 sectors as supported by the relevant government bureaux/departments (B/Ds). The target beneficiaries to be invited are either talent in shortage or that their participation in the short-term activities concerned is conducive to achieving certain policy objectives. Details of the 17 designated sectors are as follows:

If the eligible visitors are Mainland residents, they are required to apply for travel documents and exit endorsements corresponding to their nature of coming to Hong Kong from the relevant Mainland authorities in accordance with the prevailing requirements. The invitation letters are not approval documents for them to enter Hong Kong and are not supporting documents for their applications for relevant travel documents and exit endorsements from the Mainland authorities.

 NOT guarantee that the eligible visitors&rsquo; applications for visit visa / entry permit (if applicable) will be approved. If the eligible visitors are Mainland residents, they are required to apply for travel documents and exit endorsements corresponding to their nature of coming to Hong Kong from the relevant Mainland authorities in accordance with the prevailing requirements. The invitation letters are NOT approval documents for them to enter Hong Kong and are NOT supporting documents for their applications for relevant travel documents and exit endorsements from the Mainland authorities;

 NOT guarantee that the eligible visitors will be granted permission to land in the HKSAR. All eligible visitors will be subject to immigration examination upon arrival in the HKSAR. They should meet the eligibility criteria for entry for visit and normal immigration requirements.

 Eligible visitors who intend to take employment / participate in activities beyond the scope of the STV Scheme, establish or join in any business, or take up studies in the HKSAR should apply for appropriate visas / entry permits from the Immigration Department. In accordance with the Immigration Ordinance (Cap. 115), persons who have breached the conditions of stay are liable to prosecution and removal from the HKSAR.

 Frequently Asked Questions 

 Q1. Is the STV Scheme applicable to ALL organisations / companies / groups in Hong Kong such that they may sponsor visitors to come to Hong Kong to participate in short-term activities organised by them? 

 A. Under the STV Scheme, the host organisations sponsoring visitors to come to Hong Kong to participate in specified short-term activities MUST be endorsed by the relevant government bureaux / departments. The list of authorised host organisations and the scope of facilitation under the STV Scheme as endorsed by the relevant bureaux / departments can be found here .

 Q2. How is the duration of &ldquo;up to 14 consecutive calendar days&rdquo; for participating in the designated activities upon each arrival in Hong Kong counted? 

 A. Eligible visitors may, during a period of up to 14 consecutive calendar days upon each arrival, participate in the designated short-term activities. The period is counted from the day when they start to participate in such activities. For example:

 A visitor arrives in Hong Kong on 5 August and is permitted to remain in Hong Kong for 90 days. He/She starts to participate in the designated short-term activities on 11 August. The period of up to 14 consecutive calendar days during which he/she may participate in the designated activities is:

 Start Day | 
 End Day | 

 11 August
(i.e. Day 1) | 
 24 August
(i.e. Day 14) | 

 Q3. I have been invited by an authorised host organsation to come to Hong Kong to participate in a designated short-term activity. While the whole activity will last for 20 days, I will participate in part of it for 5 consecutive days only. Am I still eligible for the facilitation under the STV Scheme? 

 A. As you will only participate in the designated short-term activities for a period of not more than 14 consecutive calendar days, you are eligible for the facilitation under the STV Scheme.

 Q4. I have been granted permission to remain in Hong Kong as a visitor for 90 days. After I have participated in the designated short-term activities for not more than 14 consecutive calendar days, can I continue to stay in Hong Kong for sight-seeing and visiting friends? How long may I stay in Hong Kong? 

 A. You may stay in Hong Kong as a visitor until the expiry of your limit of stay.

 Q5. I am a national of country who require a visa to visit Hong Kong. I have already been issued with an invitation letter by an authorised host organisation for coming to Hong Kong to participate in a designated short-term activity. Is the invitation letter a &ldquo;visa letter&rdquo; such that I can come to Hong Kong without the need to apply for a visit visa? 

 A. The invitation letters issued by authorised host organisations are NOT &ldquo;visa / entry permit letters" issued by the Immigration Department for entering Hong Kong. For persons who do not enjoy visa-free concession for visiting Hong Kong, they must obtain visit visas / entry permits before coming to Hong Kong. For Mainland, Macao and Taiwan residents, the prevailing entry arrangement for visiting Hong Kong will continue to apply.

 Q6. I have been issued with an invitation letter by an authorised host organisation. Upon my arrival in Hong Kong, do I have to present the invitation letter for immigration clearance? Do I have to carry the invitation letter with me when I participate in the designated short term activity / activities in Hong Kong? 

 A. Upon arrival, you will be subject to immigration examination. While it is not mandatory for you to present the invitation letter for arrival immigration clearance, you should bring the invitation letter when coming to Hong Kong and participating in the specified short-term activities. This can facilitate the immigration examination and verification at the locations of activities, if necessary.

 Q7. Upon arrival in Hong Kong, I was granted permission to remain in Hong Kong for 7 days. How long can I participate in the designated short-term activities under the STV Scheme? Does the invitation letter issued to me by an authorised host organisation entitle me to remain in Hong Kong for 14 days or more? 

 A. For invitees who have been permitted to remain in Hong Kong for less than 14 days, the duration they can participate in the designated activities will be shorter accordingly. In this regard, the invitation letter issued by authorised host organisations will not entitle them to remain in Hong Kong for longer.

 Q8. I have been invited to participate in a short-term activity in Hong Kong. Where can I seek assistance if I am uncertain whether I am eligible for the facilitative arrangements under the STV Scheme or should apply for an employment visa / entry permit? 

 A. You may enquire with the relevant bureaux / departments listed under the "Specified Short-term Activities in 17 Designated Sectors". You may also call the STV Hotline at (852) 3861 8414 during office hours (from 8:45 am to 5:15 pm, Monday to Friday) or send an e-mail to enquiry@immd.gov.hk for enquiries.
