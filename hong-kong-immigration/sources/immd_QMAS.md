 Overview 

 This webpage aims at providing information to individuals who wish to come to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (hereafter &ldquo;HKSAR&rdquo;) of the People's Republic of China (hereafter &ldquo;PRC&rdquo;) under the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme (hereafter &ldquo;the Scheme&rdquo;).

 Scheme Objective 

 The Scheme seeks to attract highly skilled or talented persons to settle in Hong Kong in order to enhance Hong Kong's economic competitiveness. Applicants are not required to have secured an offer of local employment before applying for entry or being admitted to Hong Kong for settlement under the Scheme. Successful applicants under the Scheme may bring their spouse or the other party to a same-sex civil partnership, same-sex civil union, &ldquo;same-sex marriage&rdquo;, opposite-sex civil partnership or opposite-sex civil union entered into by him/her in accordance with the local law in force of the place of celebration and with such status being legally and officially recognised by the local authorities of the place of celebration Note and unmarried dependent children under the age of 18 to Hong Kong, provided that they are capable of supporting and accommodating their dependants on their own financial resources without relying on public assistance in Hong Kong.

 Note 

 For the avoidance of doubt, the terms &ldquo;civil partnership&rdquo; and &ldquo;civil union&rdquo; above mean a legal institution of a nature which is akin to spousal relationship in a marriage. The same-sex civil partnership, same-sex civil union, &ldquo;same-sex marriage&rdquo;, opposite-sex civil partnership and opposite-sex civil union entered into in accordance with laws outside Hong Kong are limited to only relationships which are legally and officially recognised in the places of celebration. Such relationships normally have the following features: (a) the entering into and dissolution of the relationship are governed by legislation of the place where it is entered into; (b) the relationship requires registration by the competent authority specified by the legislation of the place where it is entered into; (c) the registration is evidenced in a written instrument issued by the competent authority; and (d) parties to the relationship have a mutual commitment to a shared life akin to spouses to the exclusion of others on a permanent basis. Such relationships do not include de facto spouse, partners in cohabitation, fianc&eacute;/fianc&eacute;e, etc.

 Scope of the Scheme 

 The Scheme is not applicable to nationals of Afghanistan, Cuba and Korea (Democratic People's Republic of).

 Selection Mechanism 

 Stage 1: Prerequisites 

 Applicants under the Scheme are required to fulfil a set of prerequisites before they can be further assessed via one of the two assessment routes under the Scheme.

 Stage 2: Assessment Routes 

 Applicants who have met all the prerequisites may choose to be assessed either under the General Points Test or the Achievement-based Points Test . There are 12 assessment criteria under the General Points Test and two assessment criteria under the Achievement-based Points Test .

 A passing threshold is set under the General Points Test . Persons who choose the General Points Test are advised to assess whether their credentials are adequate to meet the passing threshold before submitting an application.

 Stage 3: Selection exercise 

 Selection exercises will be conducted on a regular basis. During each selection exercise, applicants who meet both the prerequisites and the passing threshold (under the General Points Test ) or one of the assessment criteria (under the Achievement-based Points Test ) will be considered. In general, not all applications meeting both the prerequisites and the passing threshold will necessarily be approved and applications meeting more assessment criteria will be considered more favourably. The Director of Immigration may seek advice on the applicants from a high-level Assessment Panel chaired by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare. The Assessment Panel will take a holistic view of the manpower requirements in different sectors and industries, socio-economic needs of Hong Kong, the background and credentials of applicants, and other relevant factors and advise the Director of Immigration on the applicants&rsquo; suitability. The selection is on a merit basis according to the circumstances of each case and the above-mentioned factors. As it takes time to process applications, applicants may regard their applications as being under processing unless they receive a notification of application result from the Immigration Department.

 Stage 4: Issuance of visa/entry permit 

 Successful applicants will be issued with a visa/ entry permit (in the form of &ldquo;e-Visa&rdquo;) under the Scheme for staying in Hong Kong.

 Prerequisites 

 Applicants must meet all of the following prerequisites:

 Age
 The applicant must be aged 18 or above when submitting an application under the Scheme.

 Financial Requirement
 The applicant must be able to demonstrate that he/she is capable of supporting and accommodating himself/herself and his/her dependant(s), if any, on his/her own financial resources without relying on public assistance during his/her stay in Hong Kong.

 Basic Academic Qualifications
 The applicant must have a good educational background, normally a first degree from a recognized university or tertiary educational institution. Under special circumstances, good technical qualifications, proven professional abilities, and/or experience and achievements supported by documentary evidence may be considered.

 If the applicant fails to provide satisfactory supporting documents showing that he/she has met all the above prerequisites, his/her application will not be further processed and will be refused immediately.

 Entry of Dependants 

 Applicants under the Scheme may apply to bring in their spouse or the other party to a same-sex civil partnership, same-sex civil union, &ldquo;same-sex marriage&rdquo;, opposite-sex civil partnership or opposite-sex civil union entered into by him/her in accordance with the local law in force of the place of celebration and with such status being legally and officially recognised by the local authorities of the place of celebration Note and unmarried dependent children under the age of 18 to Hong Kong under the prevailing dependant policy. Persons admitted or applying for admission under the Scheme will be the sponsor of his/her accompanying dependants to Hong Kong.

 Entry Arrangement 

 Applicants who are selected in the selection exercise will be informed in writing. Applicants who are Chinese residents of the Mainland, including those currently residing in the HKSAR or the Macao Special Administrative Region (hereafter &ldquo;Macao SAR&rdquo;) on a temporary basis, must submit a letter of consent from their present working unit or relevant Mainland authorities where their records are kept, agreeing to release them to reside in Hong Kong.

 An applicant must fully satisfy the Immigration Department that all statements made and information provided during the application process are true and complete before approval could be granted.

 After approval is granted, the applicant and his/her dependants, if any, will be issued with a visa/entry permit (in the form of &ldquo;e-Visa&rdquo; ) for staying in Hong Kong under the Scheme.

 A Hong Kong resident who has previously entered Hong Kong pursuant to any immigration policy or scheme (including, but not limited to, the General Employment Policy and the Admission Scheme for Mainland Talents and Professionals) and is subject to a condition/conditions of stay in Hong Kong may only apply under the Scheme on the condition that his/her application will be assessed on the basis that the applicant, his/her spouse or the other party to a same-sex civil partnership, same-sex civil union, &ldquo;same-sex marriage&rdquo;, opposite-sex civil partnership or opposite-sex civil union entered into by him/her in accordance with the local law in force of the place of celebration and with such status being legally and officially recognised by the local authorities of the place of celebration Note and dependent children (if any), are regarded as fresh entrants not having the right to enter and remain in the HKSAR. After approval is granted, the applicant will be issued with a visa/entry permit (in the form of &ldquo;e-Visa&rdquo;) under the Scheme.

 Upon immigration arrival clearance in Hong Kong, an &ldquo;e-Visa&rdquo; holder should present his/her valid travel document and the &ldquo;e-Visa&rdquo; saved on a personal mobile device or printed on a sheet of A4 white paper, and scan the encrypted QR code on the &ldquo;e-Visa&rdquo; with the optical reader at an immigration counter.

 A Chinese resident of the Mainland, including those who are currently residing in the HKSAR or the Macao SAR on a temporary basis, is required to obtain an Exit-Entry Permit for Travelling to and from Hong Kong and Macao (hereafter &ldquo;EEP&rdquo;) and a relevant exit endorsement from the relevant Mainland authorities before coming to Hong Kong for residence under the Scheme if his/her application is approved.

 An overseas Chinese national holding a PRC passport who submits an application from overseas and who has permanent residence overseas or who has been residing overseas for at least one year immediately before submission of the application (&ldquo;overseas&rdquo; means countries or territories outside the Mainland, the HKSAR, the Macao SAR and Taiwan) may apply to come to Hong Kong for residence under the Scheme on strength of his/her valid PRC passport. The EEP and relevant exit endorsement mentioned in the above paragraph are not required for the purpose of entering Hong Kong under the Scheme in respect of the above mentioned overseas Chinese national.

 Note: 

 For the avoidance of doubt, the terms &ldquo;civil partnership&rdquo; and &ldquo;civil union&rdquo; above mean a legal institution of a nature which is akin to spousal relationship in a marriage. The same-sex civil partnership, same-sex civil union, &ldquo;same-sex marriage&rdquo;, opposite-sex civil partnership and opposite-sex civil union entered into in accordance with laws outside Hong Kong are limited to only relationships which are legally and officially recognised in the places of celebration. Such relationships normally have the following features: (a) the entering into and dissolution of the relationship are governed by legislation of the place where it is entered into; (b) the relationship requires registration by the competent authority specified by the legislation of the place where it is entered into; (c) the registration is evidenced in a written instrument issued by the competent authority; and (d) parties to the relationship have a mutual commitment to a shared life akin to spouses to the exclusion of others on a permanent basis. Such relationships do not include de facto spouse, partners in cohabitation, fianc&eacute;/fianc&eacute;e, etc.

 Extension of Stay 

 Persons and their dependants admitted under the Scheme are subject to a limit of stay during their stay in Hong Kong until they acquire permanent resident status under Hong Kong laws. They are required to apply for extension of stay within four weeks before their limit of stay expires if they intend to continue their residence in the HKSAR. Applications for extension of stay and relevant supporting documents shall be submitted online with the relevant application fee paid. The application fee paid is non-refundable in any circumstance irrespective of the application result. 

 For persons admitted through the General Points Test under the Scheme 

 Persons admitted through the General Points Test under the Scheme will normally be granted an initial stay of 36 months on time limitation only without other conditions of stay upon entry. To obtain an extension of stay at the end of the 36-month period, applicants are required to provide proofs demonstrating to the satisfaction of the Immigration Department that they have taken steps to settle in Hong Kong by taking up residence here, e.g. by securing gainful employment or establishing a business. To be eligible for further extension of stay, the applicants are required to provide proofs demonstrating to the satisfaction of the Immigration Department that:

 they have settled in Hong Kong; and

 they have made contribution to Hong Kong, such as engaging in graduate, specialist or senior level gainful employment with a stable income; or establishing or joining in a business of a reasonable size in Hong Kong.

 Extensions of stay, if approved, will normally follow the pattern of &ldquo;3+2&rdquo; years on time limitation only without other conditions of stay.

 If a person admitted through the General Points Test under the Scheme has been permitted to remain in Hong Kong for not less than two years and he/she has an assessable income for salaries tax of not less than HK$2 million in the previous year of assessment, he/she will normally be granted an extension of stay on time limitation only without other conditions of stay for a period of five years. The applicant is required to provide documentary proof of his/her income level, e.g. notice of salaries tax assessment of the previous assessment year issued by the Inland Revenue Department or relevant tax documents.

 For persons admitted through the Achievement-based Points Test under the Scheme 

 Persons admitted through the Achievement-based Points Test under the Scheme will normally be granted a stay of eight years on time limitation only without other conditions of stay upon entry. Should an extension of stay be required, the applicant shall demonstrate that he/she is capable of supporting and accommodating himself/herself and his/her dependants, if any, on his/her own financial resources during his/her stay in Hong Kong.

 For dependants of persons admitted under the Scheme 

 A dependant may apply for extension of stay for residence in the HKSAR within four weeks before his/her limit of stay expires. Such applications will be considered only when the applicant continues to meet the eligibility criteria for entry for residence as dependants (including that there is no change in circumstances which would have otherwise resulted in loss of sponsorship for the applicant, e.g. change in marriage relationship between the dependent spouse and the sponsor, or death of sponsor) and the sponsor remains a bona fide Hong Kong resident living in the HKSAR.

 The length of stay of dependants of persons who are permitted to remain in the HKSAR as entrants under the Scheme will normally be linked to that of their sponsors.

 Other Information 

 In general, unless a person has the right of abode or right to land in the HKSAR, he/she requires a visa/entry permit to work or reside in the HKSAR. While each application is determined on its individual merits, an applicant should meet normal immigration requirements (such as holding a valid travel document with adequate returnability to his/her country of residence or citizenship; being of clear criminal record and raising no security or criminal concerns to the HKSAR; having no likelihood of becoming a burden on the HKSAR, etc.) as well as the relevant specific eligibility/assessment criteria detailed above before he/she may be considered for the grant of a visa/entry permit and subsequent extension of stay. It should be noted that the eligibility/assessment criteria may be subject to change from time to time without prior notice.

 Non-permanent residents of the HKSAR (including persons admitted under the Scheme and their dependants), irrespective of their nationality and type of travel document held, do not require a re-entry visa/entry permit to enter the HKSAR provided that they return within the currency of their permitted limit of stay and that the circumstances upon which they have acquired their residential status remain unchanged.

 Persons admitted under the Scheme who have ordinarily resided in the HKSAR for a continuous period of not less than seven years may apply for the right of abode in the HKSAR in accordance with the law.
