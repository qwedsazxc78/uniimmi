 Introduction 

 This webpage sets out the entry arrangements for persons who wish to enter the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (hereafter "HKSAR") for training.

 This entry arrangement does not apply to:

 nationals of Afghanistan, Cuba and Korea (Democratic People's Republic of); and

 Chinese residents of the Mainland (other than Mainland employees and business associates of well-established and multi-national companies based in Hong Kong).

 Eligibility Criteria 

 An application for a visa/entry permit to enter the HKSAR for a limited period (not more than 12 months) of training to acquire special skills and knowledge not available in the applicant's country/territory of domicile may be favourably considered if:

 there is no security objection and no known record of serious crime in respect of the applicant;

 the bona fides of the applicant and the sponsoring company are satisfied;

 the sponsoring company is a well-established company, capable of providing the proposed training;

 there is a contract signed between the sponsoring company and the applicant;

 the sponsoring company guarantees in writing the maintenance and repatriation of the applicant and that the applicant will receive training in the sponsor's premises until the end of the agreed period, after which the applicant will return to his/her place of residence; and

 the proposed duration and content of the training programme can be justified.

 In general, unless a person has the right of abode or right to land in the HKSAR, he/she requires a visa/entry permit to undergo training in the HKSAR. While each application is determined on its individual merits, an applicant should meet normal immigration requirements (such as holding a valid travel document with adequate returnability to his/her country of residence or citizenship; be of clear criminal record and raise no security or criminal concerns to the HKSAR; have no likelihood of becoming a burden on the HKSAR etc.) as well as the relevant specific eligibility criteria detailed above before he/she may be considered for the grant of a visa/entry permit. It should be noted that the eligibility criteria may be subject to change from time to time without prior notice.

 Entry of Dependants 

 Applicants admitted or seeking admission for training may apply to bring their spouse or the other party to a same-sex civil partnership, same-sex civil union, &ldquo;same-sex marriage&rdquo;, opposite-sex civil partnership or opposite-sex civil union entered into him/her in accordance with the local law in force of the place of celebration and with such status being legally and officially recognised by the local authorities of the place of celebration Note and unmarried dependent children under the age of 18 to the HKSAR under the prevailing dependant policy. Persons admitted or applying for admission for training will be the sponsors of their accompanying dependants to the HKSAR. An application for admission of a dependant may be favourably considered if normal immigration requirements and the following criteria are met:

 there is reasonable proof of a genuine relationship between the dependant and the sponsor;

 there is no known record to the detriment of the dependant; and

 the sponsor is able to support the dependant's living at a standard well above the subsistence level and provide him/her with suitable accommodation in HKSAR.

 This entry arrangement does not apply to:

 former Mainland Chinese residents residing in the Macao Special Administrative Region (hereafter "SAR") who have obtained Macao identity cards for less than seven years, unless they have acquired residence in the Macao SAR through the One-way Permit Scheme; and

 nationals of Afghanistan and Korea (Democratic People's Republic of)

 The length of stay of such dependants will be linked to that of their sponsors. Dependants are required to leave the HKSAR as and when the sponsors themselves leave Hong Kong. Dependants are not prohibited from taking up employment or studies in the HKSAR under existing policy.

 Note: 

 For the avoidance of doubt, the terms &ldquo;civil partnership&rdquo; and &ldquo;civil union&rdquo; above mean a legal institution of a nature which is akin to spousal relationship in a marriage. The same-sex civil partnership, same-sex civil union, &ldquo;same-sex marriage&rdquo;, opposite-sex civil partnership and opposite-sex civil union entered into in accordance with laws outside Hong Kong are limited to only relationships which are legally and officially recognised in the places of celebration. Such relationships normally have the following features: (a) the entering into and dissolution of the relationship are governed by legislation of the place where it is entered into; (b) the relationship requires registration by the competent authority specified by the legislation of the place where it is entered into; (c) the registration is evidenced in a written instrument issued by the competent authority; and (d) parties to the relationship have a mutual commitment to a shared life akin to spouses to the exclusion of others on a permanent basis. Such relationships do not include de facto spouse, partners in cohabitation, fianc&eacute;/fianc&eacute;e, etc.

 Processing Time 

 It will take four weeks to process a visa/entry permit application for training upon receipt of all the required documents. The ImmD would not be able to start processing the application unless all the required documents and information are received. Please refrain from making enquiries about the progress of the application unless it is absolutely necessary, as it may delay the processing of the application.

 All applications are processed and determined by the ImmD. Approval of applications is entirely discretionary and is subject to changes in government policies. The Director of Immigration reserves absolute discretion to refuse any application even if the application meets all eligibility criteria.
