 Introduction 

 This webpage sets out the arrangement for bona fide business travelers who wish to apply for the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC) Business Travel Card (ABTC) under the ABTC Scheme for travelling within the APEC economies.

 The APEC Business Travel Card (ABTC) Scheme 

 The aim of the Scheme is to enhance the mobility of business travellers among the APEC economies, thus promoting business within the region.

 The ABTC is plastic and the size of a credit card. It is normally valid for five years Note 1 . The card is good for multiple visits of two to three months to participating economies Note 2 without the need for a visa if pre-clearance has been granted.

 For card holders travelling to a participating economy where pre-clearance has been granted, they can use the special service lanes at selected control points for entry and exit clearance and enjoy streamlined immigration clearance upon presentation of the card and their valid national passport. In Hong Kong, card holders are allowed to use "resident" counters where available.

 Card holders can use the special service lanes at selected control points of participating economies regardless of whether pre-clearance has been granted by that economy. For card holders travelling to a participating economy where pre-clearance has not been granted, they are still subject to usual immigration clearance process, such as presenting valid passports and where applicable, valid visas.

 Card holders travelling to the United States can use the "fast-track" lanes (currently designated for aircrew) for passenger clearance at all international airports in the United States upon entry. However, ABTC holders are still subject to the usual immigration clearance process as applicable to other travellers, such as presenting valid passports and where applicable, valid visas for the United States. Should an ABTC holder require a visa for urgent business travel and find that there are no appointments available for the next working day, he/she may fax the US Consulate General's office at 2147 3586 to request a special appointment slot.

 Card holders can also use the special service lanes for passenger clearance at the major international airports in Canada upon entry. ABTC holders may follow signage with the APEC logo to access the lane. However, they are still subject to the usual immigration clearance process as applicable to other travellers, such as presenting valid passports and where applicable, valid visas for Canada.

 Note 1: Applications lodged on or after 1 September 2015 will be granted an ABTC normally valid for five years. Applications lodged on or before 31 August 2015 will be granted an ABTC normally valid for three years.

 Note 2: The arrangement does not apply to Chinese citizen of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region for entry into the Mainland. They should continue to use the Mainland Travel Permit for Hong Kong and Macao Residents (commonly known as the &ldquo;Home Visit Permit&rdquo;) for such entry. It also does not apply to ABTC holders of Hong Kong (China) for entry into Chinese Taipei.

 Online / 24-hour Telephone Enquiry on Application Status 

 Once the receipt of application has been acknowledged, applicant can enquire the application status here or through 24-hour telephone enquiry system (852) 3160 8663.

 Issue and Collection 

 After the completion of local processing of the application for ABTC in Hong Kong, the application will be referred to other participating economies of the ABTC Scheme for processing of the applicant&rsquo;s pre-clearance request. A notification letter with ABTC Application Number will be sent to the applicant&rsquo;s business postal address. The applicant can then check the pre-clearance status via the ABTC System website by inputting &rdquo;Hong Kong, China&rdquo; and his/her ABTC Application Number. Should the applicant find the pre-clearance results meet his/her business needs, he/she may request for the issue of an ABTC by sending a written request with his/her signature to the Department by post or by fax 2824 1161. The applicant will be informed by letter when the card is ready for collection.

 If the applicant submitted "Options for receiving an interim card" upon submission of the application, an ABTC will be automatically issued when all nominated economies have processed the pre-clearance request and a letter will be sent to the applicant for collection of the ABTC.

 The applicant may collect his/her ABTC either in person or authorise a representative to collect it on his/her behalf. Upon collection, the applicant or his/her authorised representative must produce the applicant&rsquo;s original valid passport for inspection if this has not been done when the applicant submitted the application or if the application is submitted online , and submit the applicant&rsquo;s previously granted ABTC for cancellation (if any).

 Reapply or Replacement Procedure 

 Reapply Procedure
 ABTC is valid for a maximum of 5 years from the date of issue. There is no renewal process. If the 5-year validity has expired or is soon going to expire, the applicant is required to reapply a new ABTC in exactly the same way as an entirely new application. The old ABTC will be cancelled upon collection of the new ABTC. On the other hand, an ABTC may have a shorter validity if the applicant&rsquo;s passport bears a shorter validity.

 Replacement of ABTC during the 5-year validity

 Issuance of ABTC with Updated Pre-clearance Results
 When one or more economies approved the applicant&rsquo;s pre-clearance request after the issuance of his/her first ABTC, the applicant may request for the issuance of an ABTC with the most updated pre-clearance results. Please make the request* in writing with the applicant&rsquo;s signature to the Department. Such replacement with only updating of pre-clearance results is free of charge.

 When all concerned economies have processed his/her pre-clearance request, the applicant still needs to provide a written request for the issue of an ABTC regardless an interim ABTC had been issued to him/her or not.

 New Passports
 Since the ABTC is linked to the applicant&rsquo;s current passport, the applicant is required to apply for a replacement ABTC if his/her new passport bears a different number. Please make the request* in writing with the applicant&rsquo;s signature and attach a copy of his/her new passport to the Department for issuance of replacement ABTC. A replacement fee will be charged for card replacement for the remainder of its validity period and is payable upon collection of the replacement ABTC. Upon collection, the applicant or his/her authorised representative must produce the applicant&rsquo;s original valid new passport for inspection if this has not been done when the applicant submitted the replacement application, and submit the previously granted ABTC for cancellation (if any).

 Re-issuance of ABTC Due to Lost or Damage
 If the applicant lost the ABTC or if there is any card damage, please make the request* in writing with the applicant&rsquo;s signature to the Department for issuance of replacement ABTC. A replacement fee will be charged for card replacement for the remainder of its validity period and is payable upon collection of the replacement ABTC.

 * The request for the issue of replacement ABTC with the applicant&rsquo;s signature can be sent to the Department by post or by fax 2824 1161. The applicant will be informed by letter when the replacement ABTC is ready for collection.

 Payment of Fee 

 The fee is payable upon collection of the applicant&rsquo;s ABTC. The relevant fee could be settled by cash, EPS, Octopus, Faster Payment System (FPS), Mainland e-wallets (Alipay, WeChat Pay and UnionPay App only) or cheque. The cheque should be crossed, made payable to &ldquo;The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region&rdquo;, properly dated and signed. Application fee should not be sent.
