 Note 1: 
This Scheme is not applicable to applicants who are nationals of Afghanistan, Cuba and Korea (Democratic People&rsquo;s Republic of).

 Eligibility Criteria 

 Persons who are the second generation of emigrated Chinese Hong Kong permanent residents from overseas may apply to return to work in the HKSAR under the Scheme.

 Applicants under the Scheme will have to meet, apart from normal immigration requirements, the following criteria -

 aged between 18 and 40 at the time of application;

 born overseas (i.e. not in the Mainland, the HKSAR, the Macao Special Administrative Region (hereafter &ldquo;SAR&rdquo;) or Taiwan);

 have at least one parent who is holder of a valid Hong Kong Permanent Identity Card at the time of application and was a Chinese national Note 2 who had settled overseas at the time of the applicant&rsquo;s birth;

 have a good education background, normally a first degree, but in special circumstances, good technical qualifications, proven professional abilities and/or relevant experience and achievements supported by documentary evidence may also be accepted; Note 3 

 proficient in written and spoken Chinese (Putonghua or Cantonese) or English; and

 have sufficient financial means and are able to meet the living expenses for his/her (including his/her dependants, if any) maintenance and accommodation in the HKSAR without recourse to public funds.

 Note 2: 
"Chinese national" means a person of Chinese nationality under the Nationality Law of the People's Republic of China, as implemented in the HKSAR pursuant to Article 18 of and Annex III to the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China and interpreted in accordance with the Explanations of Some Questions by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Concerning the Implementation of the Nationality Law of the People's Republic of China in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region adopted at the 19th meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress at the 8th National People's Congress on 15 May 1996.

 Note 3: 
The academic level of claimed non-local academic qualifications shall be equivalent to the locally recognised standard of Bachelor&rsquo;s, Master&rsquo;s or Doctoral degrees. The Immigration Department (hereafter &ldquo;ImmD&rdquo;) may require applicant to have his / her claimed overseas academic qualifications assessed by the Hong Kong Council for Accreditation of Academic and Vocational Qualifications at the applicant&rsquo;s own expense, if necessary.

 Entry of Dependants 

 Persons admitted or seeking admission under the Scheme may apply, under their sponsorship, to bring their spouse or the other party to a same-sex civil partnership, same-sex civil union, &ldquo;same-sex marriage&rdquo;, opposite-sex civil partnership or opposite-sex civil union entered into by him/her in accordance with the local law in force of the place of celebration and with such status being legally and officially recognised by the local authorities of the place of celebration Note 4 and unmarried dependent children under the age of 18 to the HKSAR under the prevailing dependant policy. An application for admission of a dependant under the Scheme may be favourably considered if normal immigration requirements and the following criteria are met:

 there is reasonable proof of a genuine relationship between the dependant and the sponsor;

 there is no known record to the detriment of the dependant; and

 the sponsor is able to support the dependant&rsquo;s living at a standard well above the subsistence level and provide him/her with suitable accommodation in the HKSAR.

 This entry arrangement for dependant does not apply to: 

 former Mainland Chinese residents residing in the Macao (SAR) who have obtained Macao identity cards for less than seven years, unless they have acquired residence in the Macao SAR through channels other than the One-way Permit Arrangements; and

 nationals of Afghanistan and Korea (Democratic People&rsquo;s Republic of).

 The length of stay of such dependants will normally be linked to that of their sponsors. Any subsequent applications for extension of stay of such dependants will be considered only if the dependants continue to meet the eligibility criteria for entry for residence as dependants (including that there is no change in circumstances which would have otherwise resulted in loss of sponsorship for the applicant, e.g. change in marriage relationship between the dependent spouse and the sponsor, or death of sponsor) and the sponsor remains a bona fide Hong Kong resident living in the HKSAR. These dependants are not prohibited from taking up employment or studies in the HKSAR under the existing policy. For further details on the entry and extension of stay arrangements for dependants, please refer to the Guidebook for Entry for Residence as Dependants in Hong Kong [ID(E) 998].

 Note 4: 
For the avoidance of doubt, the terms &ldquo;civil partnership&rdquo; and &ldquo;civil union&rdquo; above mean a legal institution of a nature which is akin to spousal relationship in a marriage. The same-sex civil partnership, same-sex civil union, &ldquo;same-sex marriage&rdquo;, opposite-sex civil partnership and opposite-sex civil union entered into in accordance with laws outside Hong Kong are limited to only relationships which are legally and officially recognised in the places of celebration. Such relationships normally have the following features: (a) the entering into and dissolution of the relationship are governed by legislation of the place where it is entered into; (b) the relationship requires registration by the competent authority specified by the legislation of the place where it is entered into; (c) the registration is evidenced in a written instrument issued by the competent authority; and (d) parties to the relationship have a mutual commitment to a shared life akin to spouses to the exclusion of others on a permanent basis. Such relationships do not include de facto spouse, partners in cohabitation, fianc&eacute;/fianc&eacute;e, etc.

 Processing of Application 

 The ImmD will not be able to start processing the application unless all the required documents and the relevant application fee are received. As it will take time to process applications, applicants may regard their applications as being under process unless they have received a notification of application result from the ImmD.

The Director of Immigration reserves absolute discretion to refuse any application even if the application meets all eligibility criteria.
