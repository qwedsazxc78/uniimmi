 Introduction 

 This webpage sets out the entry arrangement for persons who wish to enter/stay in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) for employment under TechTAS.

 TechTAS provides a fast-track arrangement for eligible companies to admit non-local technology talent to undertake research and development (R&D) work for them in the HKSAR. Eligible companies would have to apply for a quota. A company allotted with a quota by the Innovation and Technology Commission (ITC) can accordingly sponsor an eligible person to apply for an employment visa/entry permit. Companies applying for quotas may submit employment visa/entry permit applications to the Immigration Department (ImmD) irrespective of whether a valid quota has been allotted. For details of TechTAS, please refer to the &ldquo; Application Guide&ndash;TechTAS 01 &rdquo; and &ldquo; Application Guide&ndash;TechTAS 02 &rdquo; in the website of ITC .

 For details of the Technology Talent Admission Scheme (for Companies Subsidised under the New Industrialisation Acceleration Scheme) (TechTAS-NIAS), please click here for details of the entry arrangements and refer to the &lsquo; Application Guide (TechTAS-NIAS) &rsquo; in the website of ITC .

 TechTAS does not apply to nationals of Afghanistan, Cuba and Korea (Democratic People&rsquo;s Republic of).

 Eligibility Criteria 

 An application for a visa/entry permit to take up employment under TechTAS may be favourably considered if:

 there is no security objection and no known record of serious crime in respect of the applicant;

 the employing company has a valid quota approved by ITC;

 the applicant is employed as a full-time employee in the HKSAR by the employing company;

 the applicant is engaged principally in conducting R&D Note 1 in a technology area;

 the applicant is a degree-holder in science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) from a well-recognised university, which is among the top 100 universities for STEM-related subjects in the latest publication of any of the following world university ranking tables:

 Work experience is not compulsory for those with a Master&rsquo;s or Doctoral degree, whereas those with a Bachelor&rsquo;s degree only should possess a minimum of one year working experience in the relevant technology area. Persons not meeting the academic requirements but possessing good technical skills in specialty areas, proven professional abilities and/or relevant experience and achievements can be considered on a case-by-case basis with full justifications. In such case, relevant documentary evidence should be provided;

 the applicant is offered remuneration not lower than the prevailing market level for comparable jobs in the HKSAR;

 the applicant meets the specific particulars pertaining to the job position set out in the quota allotment letter issued by ITC; and

 the bona fides of the employing company and the applicant are not in doubt.

 In general, unless a person has the right of abode or right to land in the HKSAR, he/she requires a visa/entry permit to work or reside in the HKSAR. While each application is determined on its individual merits, an applicant should meet normal immigration requirements (such as holding a valid travel document with adequate returnability to his/her country of residence or citizenship; be of clear criminal record and raise no security or criminal concerns to the HKSAR; have no likelihood of becoming a burden on the HKSAR, etc.) as well as the relevant specific eligibility criteria detailed above before he/she may be considered for the grant of a visa/entry permit and subsequent extension of stay. It should be noted that the eligibility criteria may be subject to change from time to time without prior notice.

 Note 1: 
An R&D activity is &ndash;
(a) an activity in the fields of natural or applied science to extend knowledge;
(b) an original and planned investigation carried on with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding; or
(c) the application of research findings or other knowledge to a plan or design for producing or introducing new or substantially improved materials, devices, products, processes, systems or services before they are commercially produced or used.

 For details, please refer to Annex A of the Application Guide of the Technology Talent Admission Scheme.

 Entry of Dependants 

 Persons admitted or seeking admission under TechTAS may apply, under their sponsorship, to bring their spouse or the other party to a same-sex civil partnership, same-sex civil union, &ldquo;same-sex marriage&rdquo;, opposite-sex civil partnership or opposite-sex civil union entered into by him/her in accordance with the local law in force of the place of celebration and with such status being legally and officially recognised by the local authorities of the place of celebration Note 2 and unmarried dependent children under the age of 18 to the HKSAR under the prevailing dependant policy. Persons admitted or applying for admission under TechTAS will be the sponsors of their accompanying dependants to the HKSAR. An application for admission of a dependant may be favourably considered if normal immigration requirements and the following criteria are met:

 there is reasonable proof of a genuine relationship between the dependant and the sponsor;

 there is no known record to the detriment of the dependant; and

 the sponsor is able to support the dependant's living at a standard well above the subsistence level and provide him/her with suitable accommodation in the HKSAR.

 This entry arrangement does not apply to:

 former Chinese residents of the Mainland residing in the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR) who have obtained Macao identity cards for less than seven years, unless they have acquired residence in the Macao SAR through the One-way Permit Scheme; and

 nationals of Afghanistan and Korea (Democratic People's Republic of).

 The length of stay of such dependants will normally be linked to that of their sponsors. They will remain in the HKSAR on time limitation only without other conditions of stay and are not prohibited from taking up employment or studies in the HKSAR. Any subsequent applications for extension of stay of such dependants will be considered only if the applicants continue to meet the eligibility criteria for entry for residence as dependants (including that there is no change in circumstances which would have otherwise resulted in loss of sponsorship for the applicant, e.g. change in marriage relationship between the dependent spouse and the sponsor, or death of sponsor) and the sponsor remains a bona fide Hong Kong resident living in the HKSAR.

 Note 2: 

 For the avoidance of doubt, the terms &ldquo;civil partnership&rdquo; and &ldquo;civil union&rdquo; above mean a legal institution of a nature which is akin to spousal relationship in a marriage. The same-sex civil partnership, same-sex civil union, &ldquo;same-sex marriage&rdquo;, opposite-sex civil partnership and opposite-sex civil union entered into in accordance with laws outside Hong Kong are limited to only relationships which are legally and officially recognised in the places of celebration. Such relationships normally have the following features: (a) the entering into and dissolution of the relationship are governed by legislation of the place where it is entered into; (b) the relationship requires registration by the competent authority specified by the legislation of the place where it is entered into; (c) the registration is evidenced in a written instrument issued by the competent authority; and (d) parties to the relationship have a mutual commitment to a shared life akin to spouses to the exclusion of others on a permanent basis. Such relationships do not include de facto spouse, partners in cohabitation, fianc&eacute;/fianc&eacute;e, etc.

 Processing Time 

 It normally takes two weeks to process applications for employment visa/entry permit under TechTAS upon receipt of all the required documents and the relevant application fee. The Immigration Department (ImmD) will not be able to finalise the processing of the application unless all the required documents and the relevant application fee have been received. As it will take time to process applications, applicants may regard their applications as being under processing unless they have received a notification of application result from ImmD.

 All visa/entry permit applications are processed and determined by the ImmD, after taking into consideration all circumstances of the applications. Approval of applications is entirely discretionary and is subject to changes in government policies. The Director of Immigration reserves absolute discretion to refuse any application even if the application meets all eligibility criteria.
