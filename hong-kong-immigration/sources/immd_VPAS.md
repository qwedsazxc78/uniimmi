 Introduction

 [Note : Applications will be open upon graduation of the first batch of eligible non-local students enrolled in designated full-time Vocational Training Council Higher Diploma programmes in mid-2026.] 

 This webpage sets out the entry arrangements for persons who wish to apply for employment in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (hereafter &ldquo;HKSAR&rdquo;) under the Vocational Professionals Admission Scheme (hereafter &ldquo;VPAS&rdquo;).

 The VPAS is a pilot scheme, which enables non-local students Note 1 enrolled in eligible Vocational Training Council (hereafter &ldquo;VTC&rdquo;) full-time Higher Diploma programmes Note 2 in the HKSAR for the specified academic years to apply upon graduation to remain in the HKSAR for employment in the skilled trades relevant to their programmes of study.

 The VPAS does not apply to nationals of Afghanistan, Cuba, Laos, Korea (Democratic People&rsquo;s Republic of), Nepal and Vietnam, and persons who have been permitted to remain in the HKSAR under the Immigration Arrangements for Non-local Graduates.

 Note 1ï¼ Non-local students refer to persons entering the HKSAR for the purpose of education with a student visa/entry permit issued by the Director of Immigration.

 Note 2ï¼ The list of eligible programmes under the VPAS is available on the website of the VTC .

 Eligibility Criteria 

 Non-local VTC graduates refer to those non-local students admitted to the HKSAR to take up study in the specified academic years who have completed an eligible VTC full-time Higher Diploma programme within three academic years after admission. They shall submit applications to the Immigration Department (hereafter &ldquo;ImmD&rdquo;) no later than 12 months after the date of graduation (i.e. the date as shown on their graduation certificates). The applicants must be aged 18 or above when submitting an application under the VPAS.

 Overseas Chinese nationals holding People&rsquo;s Republic of China (PRC) passports who meet the eligibility criteria and application details stipulated in this guidebook and normal immigration requirements may apply to remain in / return to the HKSAR for employment under the VPAS if:

 the applicant has permanent residence overseas; or

 the applicant has been residing overseas for at least one year immediately before the submission of application (&ldquo;overseas&rdquo; means countries or territories outside Chinese Mainland, the HKSAR, the Macao Special Administrative Region (Macao SAR) and Taiwan) and that the application is submitted from overseas.

 Application Details 

 Category A applicants 

 Granting of &ldquo;initial stay&rdquo; 

 Non-local VTC graduates who wish to apply to remain in the HKSAR for taking up employment under the VPAS should apply to the VTC for a &ldquo;Proof of First Application Eligibility (Category A applicants)&rdquo; Note 3 . Non-local VTC graduates who submit applications to the ImmD after obtaining the &ldquo;Proof of First Application Eligibility (Category A applicants)&rdquo; from the VTC and within six months after the date of graduation are classified as Category A applicants. Category A applicants are not required to have secured an offer of employment at the time of application. Provided that normal immigration requirements are met, they may be granted 12 months&rsquo; stay on time limitation only without other conditions of stay to seek and take up a full-time job relevant to the disciplines of their programmes of study (hereafter &ldquo;full-time job relevant to their disciplines&rdquo;). Each Category A applicant (irrespective of the number of eligible VTC full-time Higher Diploma programmes completed under the VPAS) can only be granted such &ldquo;initial stay&rdquo; once under the VPAS.

 Note 3ï¼ The &ldquo;Proof of First Application Eligibility (Category A applicants)&rdquo; is issued by the VTC for Category A applicants to verify that they have enrolled in an eligible VTC full-time locally-accredited programme in the HKSAR in the specified academic years, have completed the programme within three academic years after admission and have obtained higher diploma qualifications.

 Category B applicants 

 Application to return to work in the HKSAR 

 Non-local VTC graduates who submit applications to the ImmD to return to work in the HKSAR within 7th to 12th months after the date of graduation are classified as Category B applicants. Category B applicants are required to have secured an offer of a full-time job relevant to their disciplines, which is at a level commonly taken up by holders of higher diploma qualifications or above, with the remuneration package at market level and an employment contract period of not less than one year. Upon application, they are required to furnish the &ldquo;Proof of First Application Eligibility (Category B applicants&rdquo; Note 4 issued by the VTC. Applicants who have established or joined in a business in the HKSAR will not be regarded as having secured an offer of employment.

 Successful applicants will normally be granted 24 months&rsquo; stay on employment condition, or in accordance with the duration of the employment contract (whichever is earlier) and shall only take such employment as approved by the Director of Immigration.

 Note 4ï¼ The &ldquo;Proof of First Application Eligibility (Category B applicants)&rdquo; is issued by the VTC for Category B applicants to verify that (a) they have enrolled in an eligible VTC full-time locally-accredited programme in the HKSAR in the specified academic years, have completed the programme within three academic years after admission and have obtained higher diploma qualifications, and (b) they have secured an offer of a full-time job relevant to their disciplines, which is at a level commonly taken up by holders of higher diploma qualifications or above, with the remuneration package at market level and an employment contract period of not less than one year. Applicants who have established or joined in a business in the HKSAR will not be regarded as having secured an offer of employment.

 Entry of Dependants 

 Persons admitted or seeking admission under the VPAS may apply to bring their spouse or the other party to a same-sex civil partnership, same-sex civil union, &ldquo;same-sex marriage&rdquo;, opposite-sex civil partnership or opposite-sex civil union entered into by him/her outside Hong Kong in accordance with the local law in force of the place of celebration and with such status being legally and officially recognised by the local authorities of the place of celebration Note 5 and unmarried dependent children under the age of 18 to the HKSAR under the prevailing dependant policy. Persons admitted or applying for admission to take up employment in the HKSAR under the VPAS will be the sponsors of their accompanying dependants to the HKSAR. An application for admission of a dependant may be favourably considered if normal immigration requirements and the following criteria are met:

 there is reasonable proof of a genuine relationship between the dependant and the sponsor;

 there is no known record to the detriment of the dependant; and

 the sponsor is able to support the dependant&rsquo;s living at a standard well above the subsistence level and provide him/her with suitable accommodation in the HKSAR.

 This entry arrangement does not apply to:

 former Chinese Mainland residents residing in the Macao SAR who have obtained Macao identity cards for less than seven years, unless they have acquired residence in the Macao SAR through the One-way Permit Scheme; and

 nationals of Afghanistan and Korea (Democratic People&rsquo;s Republic of).

 The length of stay of such dependants will normally be linked to that of their sponsors. They will remain in the HKSAR on time limitation and are not prohibited from taking up employment or studies in the HKSAR. Any subsequent applications for extension of stay of such dependants will be considered only if the dependants continue to meet the eligibility criteria set out above (including that there is no change in circumstances which would have otherwise resulted in loss of sponsorship for the applicant, e.g. change in marriage relationship between the dependent spouse and the sponsor, or death of sponsor) and the sponsor remains a bona fide Hong Kong resident living in the HKSAR. If their sponsor is permitted to remain on employment condition and the sponsor's employment contract is terminated before the expiry of the sponsor's limit of stay, such dependants have to leave the HKSAR within 12 weeks from the date of termination of their sponsor&rsquo;s employment contract, or before the expiry of their limit of stay, whichever is earlier.

 Note 5ï¼ For the avoidance of doubt, the terms &ldquo;civil partnership&rdquo; and &ldquo;civil union&rdquo; above mean a legal institution of a nature which is akin to spousal relationship in a marriage. The same-sex civil partnership, same-sex civil union, &ldquo;same-sex marriage&rdquo;, opposite-sex civil partnership and opposite-sex civil union entered into in accordance with laws outside Hong Kong are limited to only relationships which are legally and officially recognised in the places of celebration. Such relationships normally have the following features: (a) the entering into and dissolution of the relationship are governed by legislation of the place where it is entered into; (b) the relationship requires registration by the competent authority specified by the legislation of the place where it is entered into; (c) the registration is evidenced in a written instrument issued by the competent authority; and (d) parties to the relationship have a mutual commitment to a shared life akin to spouses to the exclusion of others on a permanent basis. Such relationships do not include de facto spouse, partners in cohabitation, fianc&eacute;/fianc&eacute;e, etc.
