 Introduction 

 This information leaflet prepared by the Immigration Department of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government (HKSARG) sets out the visa/entry permit requirements for persons wishing to enter the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) of the People's Republic of China (PRC). The information in this leaflet serves as reference only. The HKSAR immigration authorities have the right to refuse any application(s) even where the immigration requirements are met.

 In general, unless a person has the right of abode or right to land in the HKSAR, he/she requires a visa/entry permit to work, study, establish or join in any business, take up residence or to stay in the HKSAR as a visitor longer than the allowed visa free period. While each application is determined on its individual merits, an applicant should meet normal immigration requirements (such as holding a valid travel document with adequate returnability to his/her country of residence or citizenship; be of clear criminal record and raise no security or criminal concerns to the HKSAR; have no likelihood of becoming a burden on the HKSAR; etc.) as well as the relevant specific eligibility criteria detailed below before he/she may be considered for the grant of a visa/entry permit. It should be noted that the eligibility criteria may be subject to change from time to time without prior notice.

 An application for a visa/entry permit to enter the HKSAR for a visit (leisure, social or business) or transit may be favourably considered if:

 the applicant's bona fides are not in doubt;

 the applicant has adequate funds to cover the duration of his/her stay without working; and

 where the application is for a transit visa/permit, he/she holds an onward ticket to the place of his/her destination unless the destination is Chinese Mainland (the Mainland) or the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR).

 there is a genuine job vacancy;

 the applicant has a confirmed offer of employment and is employed in a job relevant to his/her academic qualifications or work experience that cannot be readily taken up by the local work force; and

 the remuneration package, including income, accommodation, medical and other fringe benefits, is broadly commensurate with the prevailing market level for professionals in the HKSAR.

 the applicant has permanent residence overseas; or

 the applicant has been residing overseas for at least one year immediately before the submission of application ("overseas" means countries or territories outside the Mainland, the HKSAR, the Macao SAR and Taiwan) and that the application is submitted from overseas.

The same-sex civil partnership, same-sex civil union, &ldquo;same-sex marriage&rdquo;, opposite-sex civil partnership and opposite-sex civil union entered into in accordance with laws outside Hong Kong are limited to only relationships which are legally and officially recognised in the places of celebration.

Such relationships do not include de facto spouse, partners in cohabitation, fianc&eacute;/fianc&eacute;e, etc.

Please see paragraphs 81 - 86 below.

 Mainland residents visiting the HKSAR may not request to prolong their limit of stay on grounds of having submitted applications under the Scheme.

 Employment under the General Employment Policy and Admission Scheme for Mainland Talents and Professionals (Technical Professionals Stream) 

 To address the problem of acute manpower shortage in skilled trades in Hong Kong, the Government of the HKSAR has introduced the Technical Professionals Stream (hereafter &ldquo;TP Stream&rdquo;) under the General Employment Policy and the Admission Scheme for Mainland Talents and Professionals, with a view to allowing a specified number of young and experienced non-degree professionals with relevant professional and technical skills to apply for entry into the HKSAR to join the specific skilled trades facing acute manpower shortage.

 An application for a visa/entry permit to take up employment in the HKSAR under the TP Stream may be favourably considered if the following eligibility criteria and the normal immigration requirements are met:

 there is no security objection and no known record of serious crime in respect of the applicant;

 the applicant is aged between 18 and 40 at the time of submission of an entry application;

 the applicant must meet the minimum qualification requirements specified for the corresponding specific skilled trades on the Technical Professional List (hereafter &ldquo;TP List&rdquo;), including academic qualifications, work experience, professional qualifications (such as local registration or licence to practise) and skills, etc. (please refer to Relevant Information of Technical Professional List );

 the applicant has a confirmed offer of employment in the HKSAR in one of the specific skilled trades on the TP List , and the employment contract must meet the minimum duration requirement applicable to that specific skilled trade (please refer to Relevant Information of Technical Professional List ); and

 the remuneration package (including income, accommodation, medical and other fringe benefits) is broadly commensurate with the prevailing market level for relevant technical professionals in the HKSAR and not lower than the prevailing median employment earnings of persons with academic qualifications at post-secondary non-degree level in the HKSAR (whichever is higher).

 This entry arrangement does not apply to nationals of Afghanistan, Cuba and Korea (Democratic People&rsquo;s Republic of).

 All entry visa/permit applications made under the TP Stream will be subject to quota. There is an overall quota of 10 000 in the first three years of its implementation, and the quota for each specific skilled trade is limited to 3 000. The quota will be allocated on a first-come-first-served basis. Quota will be deemed secured upon successful submission of an entry visa/permit application by the applicant and his/her employer through the online application system of the Immigration Department. Once the overall quota or the quota of a specific skilled trade is fully utilised, the Immigration Department&rsquo;s online application system will be temporarily suspended from accepting relevant applications.

 Technical professionals admitted under this arrangement may bring in their spouse or the other party to a same-sex civil partnership, same-sex civil union, &ldquo;same-sex marriage&rdquo;, opposite-sex civil partnership or opposite-sex civil union entered into by him/her in accordance with the local law in force of the place of celebration and with such status being legally and officially recognised by the local authorities of the place of celebration Note 1 , and unmarried dependent children under the age of 18. Please see paragraphs 81 &ndash; 86 below.

 Employment under the Technology Talent Admission Scheme 

 The Technology Talent Admission Scheme (TechTAS) provides a fast-track arrangement for eligible companies to admit non-local technology talent to undertake research and development (R&D) work for them in the HKSAR. Eligible companies would first have to apply for a quota. A company allotted with a quota by the Innovation and Technology Commission (ITC) can accordingly sponsor an eligible person to apply for an employment visa/entry permit within the 24-month quota validity period. For details of TechTAS, please refer to the &ldquo; Application Guide &ndash; TechTAS 01 &rdquo; and &ldquo; Application Guide &ndash; TechTAS 02 &rdquo; in the website of ITC . For details of the Technology Talent Admission Scheme (for Companies Subsidised under the New Industrialisation Acceleration Scheme) (TechTAS-NIAS), please click here for details of the entry arrangements and refer to the &lsquo; Application Guide (TechTAS-NIAS) &rsquo; in the website of ITC .

 the employing company has a valid quota approved by ITC at the time of application;

 the applicant is employed as a full-time employee in the HKSAR by the employing company;

 the applicant is engaged principally in conducting R&D in the areas of advanced communication technologies, artificial intelligence, biotechnology, cybersecurity, data analytics, digital entertainment, financial technologies, green technology, integrated circuit design, Internet-of-Things, material science, microelectronics, quantum technology or robotics;

Work experience is not compulsory for those with a Master&rsquo;s or Doctoral degree, whereas those with a Bachelor&rsquo;s degree only should possess a minimum of one year of work experience in the relevant technology area. Persons not meeting the academic requirements but possessing good technical skills in specialty areas, proven professional abilities and/or relevant experience and achievements can be considered on a case-by-case basis with full justifications. In such case, relevant documentary evidence should be provided;

 the applicant is offered remuneration not lower than the prevailing market level for comparable jobs in the HKSAR;

 the applicant meets the specific particulars pertaining to the job position set out in the quota allotment letter issued by ITC; and

 the bona fides of the employing company and the applicant are not in doubt.

 TechTAS does not apply to nationals of Afghanistan, Cuba and Korea (Democratic People&rsquo;s Republic of).

 Non-local graduates who submit applications to the Immigration Department within six months after the date of their graduation (i.e. the date shown on their graduation certificates) are classified as non-local recent graduates. Non-local recent graduates who wish to apply to stay and work in the HKSAR are not required to have secured an offer of employment upon application. They may be granted an initial stay of 24 months on time limitation only without any other conditions of stay provided that normal immigration requirements are met.

 Non-local graduates who submit applications after six months of the date of their graduation are classified as non-local non-recent graduates. Non-local non-recent graduates who wish to return to work in the HKSAR are required to have secured an offer of employment upon application. Their applications may be favourably considered if the job is at a level commonly taken up by degree holders and the remuneration package is at market level. They may be granted an initial stay of 24 months on time limitation only without any other conditions of stay provided that normal immigration requirements are met.

 Persons who have obtained an undergraduate or higher qualification in a full-time programme offered by a higher education institution in the Mainland cities of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area jointly established by universities of the Mainland and Hong Kong in accordance with the Regulations of the People&rsquo;s Republic of China on Chinese-Foreign Cooperation in Running Schools (GBA campus graduates) may also apply to come and work in the HKSAR under the IANG.

They may be granted 24 months&rsquo; stay on time limitation only without other conditions of stay provided that normal immigration requirements are met.

 GBA campus graduates who submit applications beyond six months of the date of their graduation are classified as GBA campus non-recent graduates. GBA campus non-recent graduates who wish to come and work in the HKSAR are required to secure an offer of employment upon application. Their applications may be favourably considered if the job is at a level commonly taken up by degree holders and the remuneration package is at market level. They may be granted an initial stay of 24 months on time limitation only without any other conditions of stay provided that normal immigration requirements are met.

 Persons admitted under the IANG are free to take up and change employment during their permitted stay in the HKSAR without the need to seek prior approval from the Director of Immigration.

 Employment as Imported Workers 

 The Enhanced Supplementary Labour Scheme (ESLS) (formerly known as Supplementary Labour Scheme or SLS), the Special Scheme to Import Care Workers for Residential Care Homes (Special Scheme) and the Sector-specific Labour Importation Schemes (Sector-specific Schemes) are implemented in the HKSAR to handle applications for importation of labour. Administered by the Labour Department, the Social Welfare Department and the concerned bureaux/departments of the Government of the HKSAR or the concerned statutory organisations of the HKSAR respectively, these schemes allow employers with genuine difficulties in recruiting suitable employees locally to import labour / care workers from outside the HKSAR.

 Employers intending to import labour/ care workers under the ESLS, the Special Scheme or the Sector-specific Schemes should pay attention to the followings:

 For importation of labour under the ESLS, employers need to first apply to the ESLS Application Office of the Supplementary Labour Division of the Labour Department for an approval-in-principle. Upon the grant of the approval-in-principle, the employer shall arrange for his/her prospective worker to each submit a visa/entry permit application within the period specified in the approval-in-principle letter. The approval-in-principle will automatically lapse if no visa/entry permit application is submitted within the aforementioned period.

 For importation of care worker under the Special Scheme, employers need to first apply to the Contract Management Section of the Social Welfare Department for quota(s). Upon the grant of quota(s), the employers shall arrange for his/her prospective care worker(s) to be imported to each submit a visa/entry permit application within the period specified in the Notice of Quota Approval (SWD-ICW-8). The quota will automatically lapse if no visa/entry permit application is submitted within the aforementioned period.

Upon the grant of quota(s), the employer shall arrange for his/her prospective labour to be imported to each submit a visa/entry permit application within the period specified in the Notice of Quota Application Result/Quota Allocation Result Notification Letter/Notice of Quota Approval (please refer to Other Details of Sector-specific Labour Importation Schemes for the reference number of the document).

 Quality Migrant Admission Scheme 

 The Quality Migrant Admission Scheme seeks to attract highly skilled or talented persons to settle in Hong Kong in order to enhance Hong Kong&rsquo;s economic competitiveness. Applicants are required to fulfil a set of prerequisites before they can be further assessed via one of the two assessment routes under the Scheme, namely the General Points Test (GPT) and the Achievement-based Points Test (APT). Prerequisites under the Scheme are:

 the applicant must be aged 18 or above when submitting an application under the Scheme;

The Assessment Panel will take a holistic view of the manpower requirements in different sectors and industries, socio-economic needs of Hong Kong, the background and credentials of applicants, and other relevant factors and advise the Director of Immigration on the applicants&rsquo; suitability. The selection is on a merit basis according to the circumstances of each case and the above-mentioned factors.
