 Introduction 

 This webpage sets out the entry arrangements for persons who wish to enter the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (hereafter &ldquo;HKSAR&rdquo;) for employment in the specific skilled trades as listed on the &ldquo;Technical Professional List&rdquo; (hereafter &ldquo;TP List&rdquo;).

 To address the problem of acute manpower shortage in skilled trades in Hong Kong, the HKSAR Government has introduced the Technical Professionals Stream (hereafter &ldquo;TP Stream&rdquo;) under the General Employment Policy (hereafter &ldquo;GEP&rdquo;) and the Admission Scheme for Mainland Talents and Professionals (hereafter &ldquo;ASMTP&rdquo;), with a view to allowing a specified number of young and experienced non-degree professionals with relevant professional and technical skills to apply for entry into the HKSAR to join the specific skilled trades facing acute manpower shortage.

 Applications under the TP Stream are subject to quota and restricted to the specific skilled trades as listed on the TP List .

 This entry arrangement does not apply to nationals of Afghanistan, Cuba and Korea (Democratic People&rsquo;s Republic of).

 Eligibility Criteria 

 An application for a visa/entry permit to take up employment in the HKSAR under the TP Stream may be favourably considered if the following eligibility criteria and the normal immigration requirements are met:

 there is no security objection and no known record of serious crime in respect of the applicant;

 the applicant is aged between 18 and 40 at the time of submission of an entry application Note 1 ;

 the applicant must meet the minimum qualification requirements specified for the corresponding specific skilled trade on the TP List, including academic qualifications, work experience, professional qualifications (such as local registration or licence to practise Note 2 ) and skills, etc. (please refer to Relevant Information of &ldquo;Technical Professional List&rdquo; );

 the applicant has a confirmed offer of employment in the HKSAR in one of the specific skilled trades on the TP List, and the employment contract must meet the minimum duration requirement applicable to that specific skilled trade Note 1 (please refer to Relevant Information of &ldquo;Technical Professional List&rdquo; ); and

 the remuneration package (including income, accommodation, medical and other fringe benefits) is broadly commensurate with the prevailing market level for relevant technical professionals in the HKSAR and not lower than the prevailing median employment earnings of persons with academic qualifications at post-secondary non-degree level in the HKSAR (whichever is higher). For the latest minimum market level of monthly remuneration package of the relevant skilled trades, please click here .

 Persons other than Chinese residents of the Mainland may apply to enter the HKSAR for employment under the TP Stream of the GEP upon meeting the eligibility criteria stipulated above and the normal immigration requirements. Overseas Chinese nationals holding the People&rsquo;s Republic of China (hereafter &ldquo;PRC&rdquo;) passports who meet the eligibility criteria stipulated above and the normal immigration requirements may also apply to enter the HKSAR for employment under the TP Stream of the GEP if:

 the applicant has permanent residence overseas; or

 the applicant has been residing overseas for at least one year immediately before the submission of an application [&ldquo;overseas&rdquo; means countries or territories outside the Mainland, the HKSAR, the Macao Special Administrative Region (hereafter &ldquo;Macao SAR&rdquo;) and Taiwan] and that the application is submitted from overseas.

 Chinese residents of the Mainland may apply to enter the HKSAR for employment under the TP Stream of the ASMTP upon meeting the eligibility criteria stipulated above and the normal immigration requirements.

 In general, unless a person has the right of abode or right to land in the HKSAR, he/she requires a visa/entry permit to work in the HKSAR. While each application is determined on its individual merits, an applicant should meet normal immigration requirements (such as holding a valid travel document with adequate returnability to his/her country of residence or citizenship; be of clear criminal record and raise no security or criminal concerns to the HKSAR; have no likelihood of becoming a burden on the HKSAR, etc.) as well as the relevant specific eligibility criteria detailed above before he/she may be considered for the grant of a visa/entry permit. It should be noted that the eligibility criteria may be subject to change from time to time without prior notice.

 Note 1: 
Not applicable to an application for extension of stay or change of employment.

 Note 2: 
If the applicant (i) was previously permitted to remain in the HKSAR on employment condition under the TP Stream of the GEP or the ASMTP, and now intends to re-apply for a visa/entry permit under the TP Stream for employment in the HKSAR in the same skilled trade (for skilled trades with more than one scope of work, this includes employment under the same or a different scope of work within the same skilled trade); or (ii) continues to be employed in the same skilled trade in the HKSAR but under a different scope of work within the currency of his/her permitted limit of stay, he/she must first obtain the relevant local registration or licence to practise. Otherwise, he/she will not be eligible for application.

 Quota 

 All entry visa/permit applications made under the TP Stream will be subject to quota. There is an overall quota of 10 000 in the first three years Note 3 of its implementation, and the quota for each specific skilled trade is limited to 3 000.

 The quota will be allocated on a first-come-first-served basis. Quota will be deemed secured upon successful submission of an entry visa/permit application by the applicant and his/her employer through the online application system of the Immigration Department (hereafter &ldquo;ImmD&rdquo;). Once the overall quota or the quota of a specific skilled trade is fully utilised, the ImmD&rsquo;s online application system will be temporarily suspended from accepting relevant applications. If any applications are ultimately unsuccessful, their allocated quota will be released for use by other applicants. The ImmD&rsquo;s online application system will then resume at a specific time to accept new entry visa/permit applications. The released quota will also be allocated on a first-come-first-served basis.

 In general, if a technical professional continues to be employed in the same skilled trade Note 4 in the HKSAR upon expiry of his/her limit of stay (whether upon completion or termination of the employment contract), his/her application for extension of stay will not be subject to quota, only that the applicants of certain skilled trades must hold a valid local registration or licence to practise (if applicable) (please refer to Relevant Information of &ldquo;Technical Professional List&rdquo; ). On the other hand, if the technical professional intends to take up employment in another specific skilled trade or, after the expiry of his/her limit of stay, return to the HKSAR to take up employment in any specific skilled trade, he/she has to apply for a new entry visa/permit, and such application will be subject to quota.

 Note 3: 
From 30 June 2025 to 29 June 2028 (both dates inclusive).

 Note 4: 
For skilled trades with more than one scope of work, this includes employment under the same or a different scope of work within the same skilled trade.

 Entry of Dependants 

 Technical professionals admitted or seeking admission under the GEP and ASMTP may apply to bring their spouse or the other party to a same-sex civil partnership, same-sex civil union, &ldquo;same-sex marriage&rdquo;, opposite-sex civil partnership or opposite-sex civil union entered into by him/her in accordance with the local law in force of the place of celebration and with such status being legally and officially recognised by the local authorities of the place of celebration Note 5 and unmarried dependent children under the age of 18 to the HKSAR under the prevailing dependant policy. Persons admitted or applying for admission under the ASMTP will be the sponsors of their accompanying dependants to the HKSAR. An application for admission of a dependant may be favourably considered if normal immigration requirements and the following criteria are met:

 there is reasonable proof of a genuine relationship between the dependant and the sponsor;

 there is no known record to the detriment of the dependant; and

 the sponsor is able to support the dependant's living at a standard well above the subsistence level and provide him/her with suitable accommodation in the HKSAR.

 This entry arrangement does not apply to:

 former Mainland Chinese residents residing in the Macao SAR who have obtained Macao identity cards for less than seven years, unless they have acquired residence in the Macao SAR through the One-way Permit Scheme; and

 nationals of Afghanistan and Korea (Democratic People's Republic of).

 The length of stay of such dependants will normally be linked to that of their sponsors. Any subsequent applications for extension of stay will be considered only when the applicant continues to meet the eligibility criteria for entry for residence as dependants (including that there is no change in circumstances which would have otherwise resulted in loss of sponsorship for the applicant, e.g. change in marriage relationship between the dependent spouse and the sponsor, or death of sponsor) and the sponsor remains a bona fide Hong Kong resident living in the HKSAR. These dependants are not prohibited from taking up employment or studies in the HKSAR under the existing policy. If their sponsor&rsquo;s employment contract is terminated before the expiry of the sponsor&rsquo;s limit of stay, such dependants have to leave the HKSAR within two months from the date of termination of their sponsor&rsquo;s employment contract, or before the expiry of their limit of stay, whichever is earlier.

 Note 5: 
For the avoidance of doubt, the terms &ldquo;civil partnership&rdquo; and &ldquo;civil union&rdquo; above mean a legal institution of a nature which is akin to spousal relationship in a marriage. The same-sex civil partnership, same-sex civil union, &ldquo;same-sex marriage&rdquo;, opposite-sex civil partnership and opposite-sex civil union entered into in accordance with laws outside Hong Kong are limited to only relationships which are legally and officially recognised in the places of celebration. Such relationships normally have the following features: (a) the entering into and dissolution of the relationship are governed by legislation of the place where it is entered into; (b) the relationship requires registration by the competent authority specified by the legislation of the place where it is entered into; (c) the registration is evidenced in a written instrument issued by the competent authority; and (d) parties to the relationship have a mutual commitment to a shared life akin to spouses to the exclusion of others on a permanent basis. Such relationships do not include de facto spouse, partners in cohabitation, fianc&eacute;/fianc&eacute;e, etc.

 Processing Time 

 It normally takes four weeks to process applications under the TP Stream of the GEP or the ASMTP upon receipt of all the required documents [including the verification results of the applicant&rsquo;s qualifications by relevant bureau(x)/department(s) or professional institution(s) (if applicable)] and the relevant application fee. The ImmD will not be able to process the application unless all the required documents and the relevant application fee have been received.

 All applications are processed and determined by the ImmD. Approval of applications is entirely discretionary and is subject to changes in government policies. The Director of Immigration reserves absolute discretion to refuse any application even if the application meets all eligibility criteria.

 If a technical professional, within two months after the termination of contract or before the expiry of the permitted limit of stay (whichever is earlier), is neither granted an extension of stay nor permitted to change employment for any reason, or no such application is submitted, he/she may submit a new application for an entry visa/permit under the TP Stream in the future to take up employment in the same skilled trade in the HKSAR. However, the entry application will be considered only if he/she has obtained a valid local registration or licence to practise (if applicable), and subject to the availability of quota at the time of application (please refer to Relevant Information of &ldquo;Technical Professional List&rdquo; ).

 Re-entry into the HKSAR
