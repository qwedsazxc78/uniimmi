 Introduction 

 This webpage sets out the entry arrangements for persons who wish to enter the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) for employment under the Top Talent Pass Scheme (hereafter &ldquo;TTPS&rdquo;).

 The TTPS seeks to attract top talents with rich work experience and good academic qualifications from all over the world to explore opportunities in Hong Kong. These top talents include high-income talents and graduates from the world&rsquo;s top universities.

 The TTPS does not apply to nationals of Afghanistan, Cuba and Korea (Democratic People's Republic of).

 Eligibility Criteria 

 Persons who wish to apply to enter the HKSAR under the TTPS are not required to have secured an offer of employment in the HKSAR upon application. They may be granted 36 months&rsquo; (Category A) / 24 months&rsquo; (Categories B and C); stay on time limitation only without other conditions of stay provided that normal immigration requirements are met. Applicants may choose to apply for the TTPS under one of the categories as listed in paragraphs (a) to (c) below:

 persons with annual income Note 1 reaching HK$2.5 million or above, or its equivalent in foreign currency, in the year immediately preceding the date of application (Category A);

 degree graduates Note 2 & 3 of the eligible universities Note 4 with at least three years of work experience Note 5 over the past five years immediately preceding the date of application Note 6 (Category B); or 

 degree graduates Note 2 & 3 of the eligible universities Note 4 in the past five years immediately preceding the date of application Note 6 with less than three years of work experience Note 5 , subject to an annual quota which is to be allotted on a first-come, first-served basis (Category C); however, Category C does not apply to those non-local students Note 7 who have obtained the undergraduate qualification in a full-time and locally-accredited programme in the HKSAR.

 An application for a visa/entry permit to enter the HKSAR under the TTPS may be favourably considered if:

 there is no security objection and no known record of serious crime in respect of the applicant; and

 the annual quota is available for allotment (applicable to Category C&rsquo;s applicants only).

 Successful TTPS applicant will normally be granted an initial stay of 36 months (Category A) / 24 months (Categories B and C) on time limitation only without other conditions of stay. Each applicant can only be granted such initial stay once.

 Overseas Chinese nationals holding People's Republic of China (PRC) passports who meet the eligibility criteria stipulated above and normal immigration requirements may apply to enter the HKSAR for employment under the TTPS if:

 the applicant has permanent residence overseas; or

 the applicant has been residing overseas for at least one year immediately before the submission of application ("overseas" means countries or territories outside the Mainland, the HKSAR, the Macao Special Administrative Region (Macao SAR) and Taiwan) and that the application is submitted from overseas.

 In general, unless a person has the right of abode or right to land in the HKSAR, he/she requires a visa/entry permit to work in the HKSAR. While each application is determined on its individual merits, an applicant should meet normal immigration requirements (such as holding a valid travel document with adequate returnability to his/her country of residence or citizenship; be of clear criminal record and raise no security or criminal concerns to the HKSAR; have no likelihood of becoming a burden on the HKSAR, etc.) as well as the relevant specific eligibility criteria detailed above before he/she may be considered for the grant of a visa/entry permit. It should be noted that the eligibility criteria may be subject to change from time to time without prior notice.

 Note 1: 
Annual income means taxable employment or business income including salary, allowances, stock options and profits from self-owned companies. Regarding business income, in general, applicants should continually hold the relevant company shares throughout the tax assessment year preceding the date of application for the calculation of the annual income they can acquire from the profits of their self-owned companies. Income generated from personal investment will not be taken into consideration.

 Note 2: 
The level of academic qualifications of applicants obtained from the eligible universities must be equivalent to the recognised Hong Kong standard of bachelor&rsquo;s degrees. For the avoidance of doubt, honourary bachelor&rsquo;s degrees will not be accepted.

 Note 3: 
Applicants are required to submit verification proof issued by a third-party credential verification organisation or the awarding institution regarding their academic qualifications, and to provide necessary information for the Immigration Department to conduct online authentication on respective platforms. For the list of third-party credential verification organisations, please click here .

 Note 4: 
The eligible universities refer to those universities/institutions on the aggregate list of eligible universities (hereafter &ldquo;the aggregate list&rdquo;), which is compiled by the Labour and Welfare Bureau. The aggregate list is based on (i) the top 100 universities/institutions in four designated world university rankings in the past 5 years, namely Times Higher Education World University Rankings, Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) World University Rankings, U.S. News and World Report&rsquo;s Best Global Universities Rankings and Shanghai Jiao Tong University Academic Ranking of World Universities; (ii) the top five universities/institutions providing specialised hotel programmes on the QS World University Rankings in the discipline of &ldquo;hospitality and leisure management&rdquo; in the past five years; (iii) the top 20 Mainland universities under the Shanghai Jiao Tong University Best Chinese Universities Ranking in the past five years and (iv) the top five specialised institutions on the QS World University Rankings in the discipline of &ldquo;Art and Design&rdquo; in the past five years. For the avoidance of doubt, the academic qualifications obtained from the continuing and professional education arms, the branch schools, the extension schools or the subsidiary schools, etc., established by the eligible universities will not be accepted. For the latest aggregate list, please click here .

 Note 5: 
The relevant work experience shall be accumulated from full-time employment, or else self-employment, after graduation.

 Note 6: 
Graduation in the past five years is counted by &ldquo;year of graduation&rdquo;.

 Note 7: 
Non-local students refer to persons entering the HKSAR for the purpose of education with a student visa / entry permit issued by the Director of Immigration.

 Entry of Dependants 

 Persons admitted or seeking admission under the TTPS may apply, under their sponsorship, to bring their spouse or the other party to a same-sex civil partnership, same-sex civil union, &ldquo;same-sex marriage&rdquo;, opposite-sex civil partnership or opposite-sex civil union entered into by him/her in accordance with the local law in force of the place of celebration and with such status being legally and officially recognised by the local authorities of the place of celebration Note 8 and unmarried dependent children under the age of 18 to the HKSAR under the prevailing dependant policy. Persons admitted or applying for admission under the respective arrangements will be the sponsors of their accompanying dependants to the HKSAR. An application for admission of a dependant may be favourably considered if normal immigration requirements and the following criteria are met:

 there is reasonable proof of a genuine relationship between the dependant and the sponsor;

 there is no known record to the detriment of the dependant; and

 the sponsor is able to support the dependant&rsquo;s living at a standard well above the subsistence level and provide him/her with suitable accommodation in the HKSAR.

 This entry arrangement does not apply to:

 former Mainland Chinese residents residing in the Macao SAR who have obtained Macao identity cards for less than seven years, unless they have acquired residence in the Macao SAR through the One-way Permit Scheme; and

 nationals of Afghanistan and Korea (Democratic People&rsquo;s Republic of).

 The length of stay of such dependants will normally be linked to that of their sponsors. Any subsequent applications for extension of stay will be considered only when the applicant continues to meet the eligibility criteria for entry for residence as dependants (including that there is no change in circumstances which would have otherwise resulted in loss of sponsorship for the applicant, e.g. change in marriage relationship between the dependent spouse and the sponsor, or death of sponsor) and the sponsor remains a bona fide Hong Kong resident living in the HKSAR. These dependants are not prohibited from taking up employment or studies in the HKSAR under the existing policy.

 Note 8: 
For the avoidance of doubt, the terms &ldquo;civil partnership&rdquo; and &ldquo;civil union&rdquo; above mean a legal institution of a nature which is akin to spousal relationship in a marriage. The same-sex civil partnership, same-sex civil union, &ldquo;same-sex marriage&rdquo;, opposite-sex civil partnership and opposite-sex civil union entered into in accordance with laws outside Hong Kong are limited to only relationships which are legally and officially recognised in the places of celebration. Such relationships normally have the following features: (a) the entering into and dissolution of the relationship are governed by legislation of the place where it is entered into; (b) the relationship requires registration by the competent authority specified by the legislation of the place where it is entered into; (c) the registration is evidenced in a written instrument issued by the competent authority; and (d) parties to the relationship have a mutual commitment to a shared life akin to spouses to the exclusion of others on a permanent basis. Such relationships do not include de facto spouse, partners in cohabitation, fianc&eacute;/fianc&eacute;e, etc.

 Processing Time 

 It normally takes four weeks to process visa/entry permit applications under the TTPS upon receipt of all the required documents and the relevant application fee. The Immigration Department will not be able to start processing the application unless all the required documents and the relevant application fee have been received.

 All applications are processed and determined by the Immigration Department. Approval of applications is entirely discretionary and is subject to changes in government policies. The Director of Immigration reserves absolute discretion to refuse any application even if the application meets all eligibility criteria.
