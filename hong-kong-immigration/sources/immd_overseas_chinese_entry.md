 Official Visits 

 Mainland officials and personnel who wish to enter Hong Kong for visit are required to obtain an Exit-entry Permit for Travelling to and from Hong Kong and Macao for official purposes and an appropriate endorsement relating to the purpose of entry at the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office.

 Private Visits 

 Visit relatives

 Mainland residents who wish to visit their relatives in Hong Kong are required to obtain an &ldquo;Exit-entry Permit for Travelling to and from Hong Kong and Macao&rdquo; (EEP) with an &ldquo;endorsement for visiting relatives (Tanqin)&rdquo; from the relevant Public Security Bureau Office.

 Group tours

 Mainland residents who wish to come here for sightseeing may join group tours organized by designated Mainland tour companies. Group tour members need to obtain an EEP and an &ldquo;endorsement for group visit (Tuandui Luyou)&rdquo; issued by the Public Security Bureau Office. As group tour visitors, they must arrive and depart together as a group.

 Individual visits

 Mainland residents from Guangdong Province and 38 cities, namely Shanghai, Beijing, Nanjing, Suzhou, Wuxi, Hangzhou, Ningbo, Taizhou, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Quanzhou, Tianjin, Chongqing, Chengdu, Jinan, Shenyang, Dalian, Nanchang, Changsha, Nanning, Haikou, Guiyang, Kunming, Shijiazhuang, Zhengzhou, Changchun, Hefei, Wuhan, Xian, Qingdao, Taiyuan, Hohhot, Harbin, Lhasa, Lanzhou, Xining, Yinchuan and Urumqi who wish to come here for sightseeing purpose in individual capacity are required to obtain an EEP and an &ldquo;endorsement for individual visit (Geren Luyou)&rdquo; from the relevant Public Security Bureau Office.

(Click here for "Notice to Mainland Residents holding Business Visit Endorsement")

 Exchanges and Visits

 Six categories of Mainland talents (including outstanding talents, scientific research talents, education talents, healthcare talents, legal talents and other talents) who meet the eligibility criteria set by the Mainland authorities and wish to enter Hong Kong for exchanges and visits are required to obtain an EEP and an "exit endorsement for talents (Rencai)" issued by the relevant Public Security Bureau Office.

 Other purposes of visit

 Mainland residents who wish to enter Hong Kong as a visitor for other purposes such as treating an illness, attending a funeral or participating in proceedings, etc are required to obtain an EEP and an &ldquo;endorsement for other purposes (Qita)&rdquo; from the relevant Public Security Bureau Office.

 Side Trips

 Under current arrangements, Mainland residents who wish to visit Hong Kong are required to obtain an EEP and an appropriate exit endorsement from the relevant Public Security Bureau Office. In general, a Mainland resident who is in possession of a valid EEP bearing a valid exit endorsement may be landed in Hong Kong as a visitor, with a limit of stay in accordance with the exit endorsement, provided that normal immigration requirements are met. The number of journeys to Hong Kong will be stated in the exit endorsement, i.e. single-journey, double-journey or multiple-journey.

 To facilitate those EEP holders who may take side trips to neighbouring places (e.g. Macao Note 1 or the high seas) and return to the Mainland via Hong Kong, the Immigration Department has implemented the following procedures:

 If an EEP holder travelling with a single-journey or double-journey exit endorsement enters Hong Kong again after a side trip before the expiry of the limit of stay previously imposed, he/she will be given permission to land with the same limit of stay as that given in the previous trip, provided that normal immigration requirements are met (e.g. if the limit of stay previously imposed is until 8 May and the EEP holder enters Hong Kong again on 4 May, he/she may be landed until 8 May).

 If an EEP holder travelling with a single-journey or double-journey exit endorsement enters Hong Kong again after a side trip on the last day of the limit of stay previously imposed, he/she will be given permission to land for one more day to facilitate his/her return trip to the Mainland, provided that normal immigration requirements are met (taking the above example, if the EEP holder enters Hong Kong again on 8 May, he/she may be landed until 9 May).

 If an EEP holder travelling with a multiple exit endorsement (except the "Tanqin" exit endorsement valid for three months) enters Hong Kong again after a side trip, he/she will be given permission to land with the limit of stay as specified on the multiple exit endorsement, provided that normal immigration requirements are met.

 A journey to Hong Kong specified on the exit endorsement will be treated as completed when the EEP holder returns to the Mainland.

 Note 1: 
With effect from 1 September 2008, Mainland residents travelling on EEP without an exit endorsement for Macao will not be permitted to enter Macao from Hong Kong by the Macao authorities.

 Transit 

 Holders of People&rsquo;s Republic of China (PRC) passports who are in transit through Hong Kong to and from another country or territory may be granted a stay of seven days on each landing without the prior need to obtain an entry permit provided that normal immigration requirements are met, including possession of valid entry facilities for the destination and confirmed onward booking for the overseas journey.

 If a Mainland resident is in possession of both valid EEP and PRC passport, he/she may, upon his/her entry into Hong Kong and in accordance with his/her purpose of visit, produce his/her EEP or PRC passport (except arriving from Macao and via Hong Kong to the Mainland) for entry into Hong Kong.

 Employment in Hong Kong 

 State employees

 (i) his/her spouse; or 
(ii) the other party to a same-sex civil partnership, same-sex civil union, &ldquo;same-sex marriage&rdquo;, opposite-sex civil partnership or opposite-sex civil union entered into by him/her in accordance with the local law in force of the place of celebration and with such status being legally and officially recognised by the local authorities of the place of celebration Note 3 ;

The same-sex civil partnership, same-sex civil union, &ldquo;same-sex marriage&rdquo;, opposite-sex civil partnership and opposite-sex civil union entered into in accordance with laws outside Hong Kong are limited to only relationships which are legally and officially recognised in the places of celebration. Such relationships normally have the following features: (a) the entering into and dissolution of the relationship are governed by legislation of the place where it is entered into; (b) the relationship requires registration by the competent authority specified by the legislation of the place where it is entered into; (c) the registration is evidenced in a written instrument issued by the competent authority; and (d) parties to the relationship have a mutual commitment to a shared life akin to spouses to the exclusion of others on a permanent basis. Such relationships do not include de facto spouse, partners in cohabitation, fianc&eacute;/fianc&eacute;e, etc.
