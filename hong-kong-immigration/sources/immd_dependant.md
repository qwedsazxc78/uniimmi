 This entry arrangement does not apply to:

 Chinese residents of the Mainland [except for those whose sponsors have been admitted to take up employment (as professionals under the General Employment Policy, the Admission Scheme for Mainland Talents and Professionals, the Immigration Arrangements for Non-local Graduates or the Technology Talent Admission Scheme, for investment to establish/join in business, or for training) or studies (in full-time undergraduate or post-graduate local programmes Note 1 in local degree-awarding institutions), or whose sponsors have been admitted as entrants under the Capital Investment Entrant Scheme Note 2 , the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme, the Admission Scheme for the Second Generation of Chinese Hong Kong Permanent Residents, the Top Talent Pass Scheme or the New Capital Investment Entrant Scheme];

 former Mainland Chinese residents residing in the Macao Special Administrative Region (hereafter &ldquo;SAR&rdquo;) who have obtained Macao identity cards for less than seven years, unless they have acquired residence in the Macao SAR through the One-way Permit Scheme; and

 nationals of Afghanistan and Korea (Democratic People's Republic of).

 Note 1: 
Local programmes refer to programmes leading to degrees awarded by local degree-awarding institutions whereas non-local programmes refer to programmes leading to degrees awarded solely by non-local institutions, irrespective of whether the programmes are jointly run by local and non-local institutions.

 Note 2 : 
The Capital Investment Entrant Scheme has been suspended since 15 January 2015, while the New Capital Investment Entrant Scheme was launched on 1 March 2024.

 Eligibility Criteria 

 For a sponsor who has been admitted into the HKSAR to take up employment (as a professional under the General Employment Policy, the Admission Scheme for Mainland Talents and Professionals, the Immigration Arrangements for Non-local Graduates or the Technology Talent Admission Scheme, for investment to establish/join in business, or for training) or studies (in a full-time undergraduate or post-graduate local programme Note 1 in a local degree-awarding institution), or who is permitted to remain in the HKSAR as an entrant under the Capital Investment Entrant Scheme Note 2 , the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme, the Admission Scheme for the Second Generation of Chinese Hong Kong Permanent Residents, the Top Talent Pass Scheme or the New Capital Investment Entrant Scheme, the following dependants may apply to join him/her for residence in the HKSAR:

 (i) his/her spouse; or

 (ii) the other party to a same-sex civil partnership, same-sex civil union, &ldquo;same-sex marriage&rdquo;, opposite-sex civil partnership or opposite-sex civil union entered into by him/her in accordance with the local law in force of the place of celebration and with such status being legally and officially recognised by the local authorities of the place of celebration Note 3 ; and

 his/her unmarried dependent children under the age of 18;

 For a sponsor who is a Hong Kong permanent resident or a resident who is not subject to a limit of stay (i.e. a resident with the right to land or on unconditional stay), the following dependants may apply to join him/her for residence in the HKSAR:

 (i) his/her spouse; or

 (ii) the other party to a same-sex civil partnership, same-sex civil union, &ldquo;same-sex marriage&rdquo;, opposite-sex civil partnership or opposite-sex civil union entered into by him/her in accordance with the local law in force of the place of celebration and with such status being legally and officially recognised by the local authorities of the place of celebration Note 3 ; and

 his/her unmarried dependent children under the age of 18;. and

 his/her parents aged 60 or above.

 An application for admission of a dependant may be favourably considered if:

 there is reasonable proof of a genuine relationship between the applicant and the sponsor;

 there is no known record to the detriment of the applicant; and

 the sponsor is able to support the dependant's living at a standard well above the subsistence level and provide him/her with suitable accommodation in the HKSAR.

 Note 1 : 
Local programmes refer to programmes leading to degrees awarded by local degree-awarding institutions whereas non-local programmes refer to programmes leading to degrees awarded solely by non-local institutions, irrespective of whether the programmes are jointly run by local and non-local institutions.

 Note 2 : 
The Capital Investment Entrant Scheme has been suspended since 15 January 2015, while the New Capital Investment Entrant Scheme was launched on 1 March 2024.

 Note 3 : 
For the avoidance of doubt, the terms &ldquo;civil partnership&rdquo; and &ldquo;civil union&rdquo; above mean a legal institution of a nature which is akin to spousal relationship in a marriage. The same-sex civil partnership, same-sex civil union, &ldquo;same-sex marriage&rdquo;, opposite-sex civil partnership and opposite-sex civil union entered into in accordance with laws outside Hong Kong are limited to only relationships which are legally and officially recognised in the places of celebration. Such relationships normally have the following features: (a) the entering into and dissolution of the relationship are governed by legislation of the place where it is entered into; (b) the relationship requires registration by the competent authority specified by the legislation of the place where it is entered into; (c) the registration is evidenced in a written instrument issued by the competent authority; and (d) parties to the relationship have a mutual commitment to a shared life akin to spouses to the exclusion of others on a permanent basis. Such relationships do not include de facto spouse, partners in cohabitation, fianc&eacute;/fianc&eacute;e, etc.

 In general, unless a person has the right of abode or right to land in the HKSAR, he/she requires a visa/entry permit to take up residence as dependant in the HKSAR. While each application is determined on its individual merits, an applicant should meet normal immigration requirements (such as holding a valid travel document with adequate returnability to his/her country of residence or citizenship; be of clear criminal record and raise no security or criminal concerns to the HKSAR; have no likelihood of becoming a burden on the HKSAR, etc.) as well as the relevant specific eligibility criteria detailed above before he/she may be considered for the grant of a visa/entry permit. It should be noted that the eligibility criteria may be subject to change from time to time without prior notice.

 Processing Time 

 It normally takes six weeks to process a visa/entry permit application for residence as dependant upon receipt of all the required documents and the relevant application fee Note (if applicable). The Immigration Department (hereafter &ldquo;ImmD&rdquo;) will not be able to start processing the application unless all the required documents and the relevant application fee Note (if applicable) have been received.

All applications are processed and determined by the ImmD. Approval of applications is entirely discretionary and is subject to changes in government policies. The Director of Immigration reserves absolute discretion to refuse any application even if the application meets all eligibility criteria.

 Note: 
An applicant who makes an application as a dependant under a &ldquo;Specified Scheme&rdquo; is required to pay an application fee and, upon approval of the concerned application, the relevant visa/ entry permit issuance fee according to the two-tiered fee structure. The application fee paid is non-refundable in any circumstance irrespective of the application result.

They may apply for extension of stay in the HKSAR with the relevant application fee paid within four weeks before their limit of stay expires. The application fee paid is non-refundable in any circumstance irrespective of the application result. Such applications will be considered only when the applicants continue to meet the eligibility criteria under the GEP.

 the applicant has an assessable income for salaries tax of not less than HK$2 million in the previous year of assessment Note .

 Introduction 

 This webpage sets out information about extension of stay for entrants admitted under the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme (hereafter &ldquo;the Scheme&rdquo;) and their dependants.

 Eligibility Criteria 

 Persons and their dependants admitted under the Scheme are subject to a limit of stay during their stay in Hong Kong until they acquire permanent resident status under Hong Kong laws. They are required to apply for extension of stay within four weeks before their limit of stay expires if they intend to continue their residence in the HKSAR. Applications for extension of stay and relevant supporting documents shall be submitted online with the relevant application fee paid. The application fee paid is non-refundable in any circumstance irrespective of the application result. 

 For persons admitted through the General Points Test under the Scheme 

 Persons admitted through the General Points Test under the Scheme will normally be granted an initial stay of 36 months on time limitation only without other conditions of stay upon entry. To obtain an extension of stay at the end of the 36-month period, applicants are required to provide proofs demonstrating to the satisfaction of the Immigration Department that they have taken steps to settle in Hong Kong by taking up residence here, e.g. by securing gainful employment or establishing a business. To be eligible for further extension of stay, the applicants are required to provide proofs demonstrating to the satisfaction of the Immigration Department that:

 they have settled in Hong Kong; and

 they have made contribution to Hong Kong, such as engaging in graduate, specialist or senior level gainful employment with a stable income; or establishing or joining in a business of a reasonable size in Hong Kong.

 Extensions of stay, if approved, will normally follow the pattern of &ldquo;3+2&rdquo; years on time limitation only without other conditions of stay.

 If a person admitted through the General Points Test under the Scheme has been permitted to remain in Hong Kong for not less than two years and he/she has an assessable income for salaries tax of not less than HK$2 million in the previous year of assessment, he/she will normally be granted an extension of stay on time limitation only without other conditions of stay for a period of five years. The applicant is required to provide documentary proof of his/her income level, e.g. notice of salaries tax assessment of the previous assessment year issued by the Inland Revenue Department or relevant tax documents.

 For persons admitted through the Achievement-based Points Test under the Scheme 
Persons admitted through the Achievement-based Points Test under the Scheme will normally be granted a stay of eight years on time limitation only without other conditions of stay upon entry. Should an extension of stay be required, the applicant shall demonstrate that he/she is capable of supporting and accommodating himself/herself and his/her dependants, if any, on his/her own financial resources during his/her stay in Hong Kong.

 For dependants of persons admitted under the Scheme 
A dependant may apply for extension of stay for residence in the HKSAR within four weeks before his/her limit of stay expires. Such applications will be considered only when the applicant continues to meet the eligibility criteria for entry for residence as dependants (including that there is no change in circumstances which would have otherwise resulted in loss of sponsorship for the applicant, e.g. change in marriage relationship between the dependent spouse and the sponsor, or death of sponsor) and the sponsor remains a bona fide Hong Kong resident living in the HKSAR.

 The length of stay of dependants of persons who are permitted to remain in the HKSAR as entrants under the Scheme will normally be linked to that of their sponsors.

 Processing Time 

 Routine applications will normally be finalised within two to three weeks upon receipt of all the required documents and the relevant application fee. 

 The processing time is subject to the circumstances of individual applications and the number of applications received at the time.

 Introduction 

 This webpage sets out information about extension of stay for entrants admitted under the Capital Investment Entrant Scheme (hereafter &ldquo;the Scheme&rdquo;) and their dependants.

 Eligibility Criteria 

 Entrants or their dependants admitted under the Scheme may apply for extension of stay within 3 months before their limit of stay expires.

 To be eligible for an extension of stay, the entrant must continue to satisfy the requirements of the Scheme throughout the period after he has been granted permission to stay. In maintaining the entrant&rsquo;s portfolio, he should comply with the portfolio maintenance requirements and the rules on any switches of his investment.

 Portfolio Maintenance Requirement 

 Portfolio maintenance and ring-fencing requirements will be imposed to ensure that the entrant does not reduce his investment commitment while he is permitted to stay in Hong Kong under the Scheme. For investments in specified financial assets, the entrant is required to transact only the said assets in Permissible Investment Asset Classes held in a designated account in his own name to be opened with a single financial intermediary Note 1 . Permissible Investment Asset Classes are set out in the Rules for the Capital Investment Entrant Scheme. Please click here for more information.

 Note 1: 
The financial intermediary must be an authorised institution as defined in the Banking Ordinance, a corporation licensed to perform Type 1, 4 or 9 regulated activities under the Securities and Futures Ordinance or an insurer authorised to carry on Class C business as specified in Part 2 of the First Schedule to the Insurance Companies Ordinance. Details of the maintenance and ring-fencing requirements are set out in the Rules for the Capital Investment Entrant Scheme . The entrant is required to undertake in the application form that he agrees to abide by the Rules while remaining in Hong Kong as an entrant under the Scheme.

 Change in Value of Investment 

 In maintaining the entrant&rsquo;s eligibility for an extension of stay, he is not required to top up the value of his investment under the Scheme if it falls below the requisite minimum investment level. However, the entrant is not allowed to withdraw any capital gains from his investment if its market value rises above the requisite minimum investment level. The entrant is free to switch investments from one permissible asset class to another (such as from real estate to specified financial assets or vice versa), provided that he reinvests the entire proceeds from the sale. The entrant should keep a record of every change to his investment portfolio for the purpose of applying for an extension of stay in Hong Kong.

 Application Forms

All of these forms can be obtained free of charge from Immigration Department Headquarters and Branch Offices. The forms can also be downloaded here .

 Note 2:

The same-sex civil partnership, same-sex civil union, &ldquo;same-sex marriage&rdquo;, opposite-sex civil partnership and opposite-sex civil union entered into in accordance with laws outside Hong Kong are limited to only relationships which are legally and officially recognised in the places of celebration.

Such relationships do not include de facto spouse, partners in cohabitation, fianc&eacute;/fianc&eacute;e, etc.
