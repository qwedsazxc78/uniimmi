An applicant for an entry visa/permit, extension of stay or change of status in Hong Kong, etc. will be issued with an &ldquo;e-Visa&rdquo;, such as &ldquo;Notification Slip for Entry Visa/Permit&rdquo; or &ldquo;Notification Slip for Conditions of Stay&rdquo;, upon approval of the application and payment of the relevant fee (where applicable). For details, please visit the &ldquo; e-Visa&rdquo; webpage.

 Who Can Use This Service
