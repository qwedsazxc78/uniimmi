 Introduction 

 This webpage sets out the eligibility criteria and application procedures for persons who wish to apply for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Travel Pass Scheme.

 Travel Pass Scheme 

 The aim of the Travel Pass Scheme is to enhance the mobility of business travellers by facilitating bona fide frequent visitors to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR). The Travel Pass is a machine readable document with 32 pages. It is valid for 3 years and good for multiple entries to the HKSAR for a stay of 2 months each trip. The holder of a Travel Pass will be allowed to use Hong Kong resident counters and the immigration clearance procedures will be simplified.
