 Relevant Period | 

 Ordinary visa / entry permit valid for 1 entry | 
 With a fixed period of
limit of stay stated on the visa / entry permit | 

 The relevant period means the fixed period of limit of stay stated on the visa / entry permit.

 With the last date under the limit of stay 
stated on the visa / entry permit | 

 The relevant period means the period beginning on the day after the date of payment of the visa issuance fee and ending on the last date under the limit of stay stated on the visa / entry permit.

 (i.e. Relevant period = Last date under the limit of stay - Date of payment of visa issuance fee)

 For example: Last date under the limit of stay: 31 March 2025

 Date of payment of visa issuance fee: 1 March 2025

 Relevant period: 30 days Note 6 

 | 

 Extension of stay (with no change to other condition of stay) | 

 The relevant period means the period beginning on the day after the last date under the limit of stay before the extension of stay and ending on the last date under the extended limit of stay.

 (i.e. Relevant period = Last date under the new limit of stay &ndash; last date under the original limit of stay before the current extension of stay)

 For example:
Last date under the new limit of stay: 31 March 2025
Last date under the original limit of stay: 1 March 2025
Relevant period: 30 days

 | 

 Change of condition of stay (e.g. change of employment) | 
 With no change to the limit of stay | 

 The relevant period means the period beginning on the day after the date of payment of the visa issuance fee and ending on the last date under the limit of stay. 

 (i.e. Relevant period = Last date under the limit of stay - Date of payment of visa issuance fee)

 For example:
Last date under the limit of stay: 31 March 2025
Date of payment of visa issuance fee: 1 March 2025
Relevant period: 30 days Note 6 

 | 

 With extension of the limit of stay | 

 The relevant period means the period beginning on the day after the date of payment of the visa issuance fee and ending on the last date under the changed limit of stay. 

 (i.e. Relevant period = Last date of the new limit of stay - Date of payment of visa issuance fee)

 For example:
Last date under the new limit of stay: 31 March 2025
Date of payment of visa issuance fee: 1 March 2025
Relevant period: 30 days Note 6

 Note 5:
