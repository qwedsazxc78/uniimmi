 Introduction 

 This webpage sets out the entry arrangements for persons who wish to enter the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) for residence under the New Capital Investment Entrant Scheme (hereafter &ldquo;New CIES&rdquo;).

 The New CIES seeks to further enrich the talent pool and attract more new capital to Hong Kong. This will strengthen the development of our asset and wealth management business, financial services and related professional services.

 The New CIES does not apply to nationals of Afghanistan, Cuba and Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

 Rules for the New Capital Investment Entrant Scheme 

 Individuals who apply to enter Hong Kong, and/or remain in Hong Kong, pursuant to the Scheme are subject to the Rules for the New Capital Investment Entrant Scheme (&ldquo;the New Scheme Rules&rdquo;).

 Eligibility Criteria 

 Subject to the terms of the New Scheme Rules, an Applicant who satisfies the following criteria will be eligible for applying for admission into Hong Kong for residence under the New CIES:

 Age &ndash; aged 18 or above at the time of applying for net asset assessment to Invest Hong Kong (hereafter &ldquo;InvestHK&rdquo;);

 Scope of the Scheme &ndash; 
(i) foreign nationals Note1 ;
(ii) Chinese nationals who have obtained permanent resident status in a foreign country; 
(iii) Macao Special Administrative Region residents; or
(iv) Chinese residents of Taiwan;

 Net assets &ndash; applies for net asset assessment to InvestHK, i.e. demonstrating that he/she has net assets or net equity (including the respective portion of jointly-owned assets or equity with the applicant&rsquo;s family member(s) which is absolutely beneficially entitled to the applicant as mentioned in paragraph 1.15 of the New Scheme Rules) to which he/she is absolutely beneficially entitled with a market value of not less than HK$30 million Net (or equivalent in foreign currencies) throughout the six months (reduced from two years effective 1 March 2025) preceding the date he/she lodged the application for net asset assessment;

 Investment in permissible investment assets &ndash; makes investment of not less than HK$30 million Net (or equivalent in foreign currencies) in the permissible investment assets Note2 to which he/ she is absolutely beneficially entitled;

 **Note on 2025 Enhancements:**
 - **Effective 1 March 2025:** The period for demonstrating net assets was shortened to the preceding six months.
 - **Effective 17 September 2025:** Investment in residential properties is allowed if the transaction price is HK$30 million or above (reduced from HK$50 million). The aggregate amount of real estate (residential and/or non-residential) that can be counted towards the minimum investment threshold is raised to HK$15 million (previously HK$10 million).

 No adverse record &ndash; demonstrates that he/she has no adverse immigration record and meets normal immigration and security requirements; and

 Others &ndash; demonstrates to the Director of Immigration that he/she is capable of supporting and accommodating himself/herself and his/her dependants, if any, on his/her own without relying on any return on the Permissible investment assets, employment, self-employment, office, business or public assistance in or carried on in Hong Kong as the case may be. In addition, the entry of dependants will be subject to any other policy applicable to such entry at the time.

 Note 1: 
Nationals of Afghanistan, Cuba, and Democratic People's Republic of Korea are to be excluded. The list of excluded countries/regions will be reviewed by the Security Bureau (&ldquo;SB&rdquo;)/Immigration Department (&ldquo;ImmD&rdquo;) from time to time. Stateless persons who have obtained permanent resident status in a foreign country with proven re-entry facilities will be eligible under the Scheme.

 Note 2: 
For more details on Net Asset Requirement, Investment Requirements and Portfolio Maintenance Requirements, please refer to the New Scheme Rules .

 Entry of Dependants 

 Persons seeking admission or admitted under the New CIES may apply, under their sponsorship, to bring their spouse or the other party to a same-sex civil partnership, same-sex civil union, &ldquo;same-sex marriage&rdquo;, opposite-sex civil partnership or opposite-sex civil union outside Hong Kong with an eligible sponsor in accordance with the local law in force of the place of celebration and with such status being legally and officially recognised by the local authorities of the place of celebration Note3 and unmarried dependent children under the age of 18 to the HKSAR under the prevailing dependant policy. Persons admitted or applying for admission under the respective arrangements will be the sponsors of their accompanying dependants to the HKSAR. An application for admission of a dependant may be favourably considered if normal immigration requirements and the following criteria are met:

 there is reasonable proof of a genuine relationship between the dependant and the sponsor;

 there is no known record to the detriment of the dependant; and

 the sponsor is able to support the dependant&rsquo;s living at a standard well above the subsistence level and provide him/her with suitable accommodation in the HKSAR.

 This entry arrangement does not apply to:

 former Mainland Chinese residents residing in the Macao SAR who have obtained Macao identity cards for less than seven years, unless they have acquired residence in the Macao SAR through the One-way Permit Scheme; and

 nationals of Afghanistan and Democratic People&rsquo;s Republic of Korea.

 The length of stay of such dependants will normally be linked to that of their sponsors. Any subsequent applications for extension of stay will be considered only when the applicant continues to meet the eligibility criteria for entry for residence as dependants (including that there is no change in circumstances which would have otherwise resulted in loss of sponsorship for the applicant, e.g. change in marriage relationship between the dependent spouse and the sponsor, or death of sponsor) and the sponsor remains a bona fide Hong Kong resident living in the HKSAR. These dependants are not prohibited from taking up employment or studies in the HKSAR under the existing policy.

 Note 3: 
For the avoidance of doubt, the terms &ldquo;civil partnership&rdquo; and &ldquo;civil union&rdquo; above mean a legal institution of a nature which is akin to spousal relationship in a marriage. The same-sex civil partnership, same-sex civil union, &ldquo;same-sex marriage&rdquo;, opposite-sex civil partnership and opposite-sex civil union entered into in accordance with laws outside Hong Kong are limited to only relationships which are legally and officially recognised in the places of celebration. Such relationships normally have the following features: (a) the entering into and dissolution of the relationship are governed by legislation of the place where it is entered into; (b) the relationship requires registration by the competent authority specified by the legislation of the place where it is entered into; (c) the registration is evidenced in a written instrument issued by the competent authority; and (d) parties to the relationship have a mutual commitment to a shared life akin to spouses to the exclusion of others on a permanent basis. Such relationships do not include de facto spouse, partners in cohabitation, fianc&eacute;/fianc&eacute;e, etc.

 Application Procedures 

 Before an applicant submits an entry application for visa/ permit under the New CIES to Immigration Department (&ldquo;ImmD&rdquo;), he/she is required to first approach InvestHK for verifying whether he/she has fulfilled the Net Asset Requirement. After InvestHK has verified and notified the applicant that he/she has fulfilled the Net Asset Requirement, InvestHK will issue a Certifying Proof for Fulfillment of Net Asset Requirement to the applicant. The applicant is then required to submit an entry application to ImmD within the validity period of the Certifying Proof for Fulfillment of Net Asset Requirement. If Approval-in-Principle is given after assessment from the immigration perspectives, ImmD will grant a visa/entry permit to the applicant for entering Hong Kong on visitor status for not more than 180 days for making the committed investment within the period.

 Upon the applicant&rsquo;s completion of the committed investment within the specified investment timeframe, an applicant is required to approach InvestHK for verifying whether he/she has fulfilled the Investment Requirements. Upon InvestHK&rsquo;s verification that the applicant has fulfilled the Investment Requirements, InvestHK will issue a Certifying Proof for Fulfillment of Investment Requirements to the applicant. The applicant is required to provide the Certifying Proof for Fulfillment of Investment Requirements within its validity period to ImmD, which will in turn resume making assessment on the applicant&rsquo;s entry application. Upon formal approval, permission to stay will normally be granted to the applicant and his/her dependants (if any) for not more than 24 months on time limitation only, subject to the condition that the applicant continues to satisfy the requirements of the Scheme throughout this period.

 Net Asset Requirement, Investment Requirements and Portfolio Maintenance Requirements 

 Under the New CIES, InvestHK is responsible for the assessment of the applicant&rsquo;s fulfillment for Net Asset Requirement, Investment Requirements and Portfolio Maintenance Requirements in compliance with the New Scheme Rules. For more details, please refer to the website of InvestHK.
