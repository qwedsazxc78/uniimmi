Besides, a person fulfills the transitional arrangement under the same Ordinance is also eligible to enjoy the right of abode. This page provides information about who belongs to these categories, the transitional arrangements and where to go for further information.

 Categories of Eligibility

 Under the Immigration Ordinance, if a person belongs to one of the following categories, he/she is a permanent resident of the HKSAR and enjoys the right of abode.

 Chinese Citizens 

 (a) | 
 A Chinese citizen born in Hong Kong before or after the establishment of the HKSAR. | 

 (b) | 
 A Chinese citizen who has ordinarily resided in Hong Kong for a continuous period of not less than seven years before or after the establishment of the HKSAR. | 

 (c) | 
 A person of Chinese nationality born outside Hong Kong before or after the establishment of the HKSAR to a parent who, at the time of birth of that person, was a Chinese citizen falling within category (a) or (b).

 The person&rsquo;s right of abode by virtue of being a permanent resident of the HKSAR under category (c) can only be exercised upon the establishment of his/her status as a permanent resident by holding :

 a valid travel document issued to him/her and a valid Certificate of Entitlement also issued to him/her and affixed to the travel document;

 a valid HKSAR passport issued to him/her; or

 a valid permanent identity card issued to him/her.

 (d) | 
 A person not of Chinese nationality who has entered Hong Kong with a valid travel document, has ordinarily resided in Hong Kong for a continuous period of not less than seven years and has taken Hong Kong as his/her place of permanent residence before or after the establishment of the HKSAR.

 The continuous period of seven years ordinary residence must be immediately before the date when the person applies to the Director of Immigration for the status of a permanent resident of the HKSAR under this category.

 The person is required to make a declaration in the form the Director of Immigration stipulates that he/she has taken Hong Kong as his/her place of permanent residence. If the person is under 21 years of age, the declaration must be made by a parent or legal guardian. For this purpose, the person will have to furnish information to satisfy the Director of Immigration that he/she has taken Hong Kong as a place of permanent residence. The information may include whether he/she has habitual residence in Hong Kong, whether the principal members of the person&rsquo;s family (spouse and minor children) are in Hong Kong, whether the person has a reasonable means of income to support himself/herself and his/her family and whether he/she has paid taxes in accordance with the law.

 Please note that a person claiming to have the status of a permanent resident of the HKSAR under this category does not have that status until he/she has applied to the Director of Immigration and the application has been approved.

 (e) | 
 A person under 21 years of age born in Hong Kong to a parent who is a permanent resident of the HKSAR in category (d) before or after the establishment of the HKSAR if at the time of his/her birth or at any later time before he/she attains 21 years of age, one parent has the right of abode in Hong Kong.
