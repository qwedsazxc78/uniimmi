 Introduction 

 This webpage sets out the entry arrangement for persons who wish to enter/stay in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (hereafter &ldquo;HKSAR&rdquo;) for employment as professionals under the Immigration Arrangements for Non-local Graduates (hereafter &ldquo;IANG&rdquo;).

 Applicants who are/were non-local students Note 1 and have obtained an undergraduate or higher qualification in a full-time and locally-accredited programme in Hong Kong (hereafter &ldquo;non-local graduates&rdquo;) may apply to stay/return and work in the HKSAR under the IANG. 

 Persons who have obtained an undergraduate or higher qualification in a full-time programme offered by a higher education institution in the Mainland cities of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area jointly established by universities of the Mainland and Hong Kong in accordance with the Regulations of the People&rsquo;s Republic of China on Chinese-Foreign Cooperation in Running Schools (hereafter &ldquo;GBA campus graduates&rdquo;) may also apply to come and work in the HKSAR under the IANG. 

 The IANG is quota-free and non-sector specific.

 The IANG does not apply to nationals of Afghanistan, Cuba and Korea (Democratic People&rsquo;s Republic of). For nationals of Laos, Nepal and Vietnam, the IANG only applies to (a) those who have obtained an undergraduate or higher qualification in a full-time locally-accredited local programme in Hong Kong offered by the University Grants Committee (UGC) funded universities, but excluding: (i) self-financing programmes offered by the relevant universities; (ii) programmes offered by the continuing and professional education arms of the relevant universities; and (iii) exchange programme or short-term studies offered by the relevant institutions; and (b) GBA campus graduates.

 Note 1: 

 Non-local students refer to persons entering the HKSAR for the purpose of education with a student visa / entry permit issued by the Director of Immigration.

 Eligibility Criteria 

 (i) Non-local graduates

 Non-local graduates here refer to non-local students who have obtained an undergraduate or higher qualification in a full-time and locally-accredited programme in the HKSAR.

 Non-local graduates who submit applications to the Immigration Department (hereafter &ldquo;ImmD&rdquo;) within six months after the date of their graduation (i.e. the date shown on their graduation certificates) are classified as non-local recent graduates.

 Non-local graduates who submit applications beyond six months of the date of their graduation are classified as non-local non-recent graduates.

 Non-local recent graduates who wish to apply to stay and work in the HKSAR are not required to have secured an offer of employment upon application. They may be granted 24 months' stay on time limitation only without other conditions of stay provided that normal immigration requirements are met. Those who intend to apply to stay and work in the HKSAR but have not yet secured graduation results may apply for extension of stay to wait for the promulgation of results. Non-local recent graduates who have not yet obtained their graduation certificate could apply to stay and work by producing proof from the institution confirming that they have graduated.

 Non-local non-recent graduates who wish to return to work in the HKSAR are required to secure an offer of employment upon application. The applications will be favourably considered so long as the job is at a level commonly taken up by degree holders and the remuneration package is at market level. They may be granted 24 months' stay on time limitation only without other conditions of stay provided that normal immigration requirements are met.

 (ii) GBA campus graduates

 GBA campus graduates here refer to persons who have obtained an undergraduate or higher qualification in a full-time programme offered by a higher education institution in the Mainland cities of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area jointly established by universities of the Mainland and Hong Kong in accordance with the Regulations of the People&rsquo;s Republic of China on Chinese-Foreign Cooperation in Running Schools.

 GBA campus graduates who submit applications to the ImmD within six months after the date of their graduation (i.e. the date shown on their graduation certificates) are classified as GBA campus recent graduates.

 GBA campus graduates who submit applications beyond six months of the date of their graduation are classified as GBA campus non-recent graduates.

 GBA campus recent graduates who wish to apply to come and work in the HKSAR are not required to have secured an offer of employment upon application. They may be granted 24 months&rsquo; stay on time limitation only without other conditions of stay provided that normal immigration requirements are met. GBA campus recent graduates who have not yet obtained their graduation certificate could apply to come and work by producing proof from the institution confirming that they have graduated.

 GBA campus non-recent graduates who wish to come to work in the HKSAR are required to secure an offer of employment upon application. The applications will be favourably considered so long as the job is at a level commonly taken up by degree holders and the remuneration package is at market level. They may be granted 24 months&rsquo; stay on time limitation only without other conditions of stay provided that normal immigration requirements are met.

 In general, unless a person has the right of abode or right to land in the HKSAR, he/she requires a visa/entry permit to work in the HKSAR. While each application is determined on its individual merits, an applicant should meet normal immigration requirements (such as holding a valid travel document with adequate returnability to his/her country of residence or citizenship; be of clear criminal record and raise no security or criminal concerns to the HKSAR; have no likelihood of becoming a burden on the HKSAR, etc.) as well as the relevant specific eligibility criteria detailed above before he/she may be considered for the grant of a visa/entry permit. It should be noted that the eligibility criteria may be subject to change from time to time without prior notice.

 Entry of Dependants 

 Applicants admitted or seeking admission under the IANG may apply to bring their spouse or the other party to a same-sex civil partnership, same-sex civil union, &ldquo;same-sex marriage&rdquo;, opposite-sex civil partnership or opposite-sex civil union entered into by him/her in accordance with the local law in force of the place of celebration and with such status being legally and officially recognised by the local authorities of the place of celebration Note 2 and unmarried dependent children under the age of 18 to the HKSAR under the prevailing dependant policy. Persons admitted or applying for admission under the IANG will be the sponsors of their accompanying dependants to the HKSAR. An application for admission of a dependant may be favourably considered if normal immigration requirements and the following criteria are met:

 there is reasonable proof of a genuine relationship between the dependant and the sponsor;

 there is no known record to the detriment of the dependant; and

 the sponsor is able to support the dependant's living at a standard well above the subsistence level and provide him/her with suitable accommodation in the HKSAR.

 This entry arrangement does not apply to:

 former Mainland Chinese residents residing in the Macao Special Administrative Region (hereafter &ldquo;SAR&rdquo;) who have obtained Macao identity cards for less than seven years, unless they have acquired residence in the Macao SAR through the One-way Permit Scheme; and

 nationals of Afghanistan and Korea (Democratic People's Republic of).

 The length of stay of such dependants will normally be linked to that of their sponsors. Any subsequent applications for extension of stay will be considered only when the applicant continues to meet the eligibility criteria for entry for residence as dependants (including that there is no change in circumstances which would have otherwise resulted in loss of sponsorship for the applicant, e.g. change in marriage relationship between the dependent spouse and the sponsor, or death of sponsor) and the sponsor remains a bona fide Hong Kong resident living in the HKSAR. These dependants are not prohibited from taking up employment or studies in the HKSAR under the existing policy.

 Note 2: 

 For the avoidance of doubt, the terms &ldquo;civil partnership&rdquo; and &ldquo;civil union&rdquo; above mean a legal institution of a nature which is akin to spousal relationship in a marriage. The same-sex civil partnership, same-sex civil union, &ldquo;same-sex marriage&rdquo;, opposite-sex civil partnership and opposite-sex civil union entered into in accordance with laws outside Hong Kong are limited to only relationships which are legally and officially recognised in the places of celebration. Such relationships normally have the following features: (a) the entering into and dissolution of the relationship are governed by legislation of the place where it is entered into; (b) the relationship requires registration by the competent authority specified by the legislation of the place where it is entered into; (c) the registration is evidenced in a written instrument issued by the competent authority; and (d) parties to the relationship have a mutual commitment to a shared life akin to spouses to the exclusion of others on a permanent basis. Such relationships do not include de facto spouse, partners in cohabitation, fianc&eacute;/fianc&eacute;e, etc.

 Processing Time 

 In general, applications submitted under the IANG by non-local recent graduates / GBA campus recent graduates take about two weeks to process upon receipt of all the required documents and the relevant application fee. For non-local non-recent graduates / GBA campus non-recent graduates, it takes four weeks upon receipt of all the required documents and the relevant application fee. However, the processing time will depend on the circumstances of individual applications and the number of applications received at a particular time. A longer processing time may be required during summer rush period between June and August. The ImmD will not be able to start processing the application unless all the required documents and the relevant application fee have been received.

 All applications are processed and determined by the ImmD. Approval of applications is entirely discretionary and is subject to changes in government policies. The Director of Immigration reserves absolute discretion to refuse any application even if the application meets all eligibility criteria.
