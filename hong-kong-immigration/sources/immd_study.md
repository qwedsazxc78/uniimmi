 Introduction 

 This webpage sets out the entry arrangement for persons who wish to enter the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (hereafter &ldquo;HKSAR&rdquo;) for study.

 Eligibility Criteria 

 An application for a visa/entry permit to enter the HKSAR for study may be favourably considered if :

 the applicant:

 is admitted to a private school registered under the Education Ordinance (Cap. 279) or Post Secondary Colleges Ordinance (Cap. 320). Except for post-secondary education, entry for study in public or aided schools (other than English Schools Foundation Schools and Direct Subsidy Scheme Schools) is not permitted;

 takes up studies in a full-time locally-accredited post-secondary programme including short-term course or part-time locally-accredited taught postgraduate local programme Note 1 ; 

 is admitted on exchange in full-time locally-accredited local programmes at sub-degree level for not more than 6 months or on exchange in full-time locally-accredited local or non-local programmes for not more than one year at undergraduate or above level; or

 is enrolled in a full-time course on the register of non-local higher education or professional courses as set up under the Non-local Higher and Professional Education (Regulation) Ordinance (Cap. 493);

 the applicant is:

 from the age of 5 years and 8 months to 11 for primary education; or

 below the age of 20 for secondary education;

 the applicant holds a school acceptance letter to confirm that he/she has been accepted for a course of study; and

 the applicant is able to meet the fees for the course, the living expenses for his/her maintenance and accommodation without working and without recourse to public funds.

 This entry arrangement does not apply to:

 Chinese residents of the Mainland and Taiwan;

 former Mainland Chinese residents settled in Macao Special Administrative Region (hereafter &ldquo;SAR&rdquo;) who were not settled there by 14 January 1979; and

 nationals of Afghanistan, Cuba, Laos, Korea (Democratic People's Republic of ), Nepal and Vietnam.

 However, provided that the conditions in sub-paragraphs 1(c) & (d) above are met, Chinese residents of the Mainland, Macao SAR and Taiwan as listed in sub-paragraphs 2(a) & (b) above and nationals of Laos, Nepal and Vietnam as listed in sub-paragraph 2(c) above may apply for entry to take up:

 For Chinese residents of the Mainland, Macao SAR and Taiwan (sub-paragraphs 2(a) & (b) above):

 studies in full-time locally-accredited post-secondary local or non-local programmes Note 2&3 ; 

 studies in part-time locally-accredited taught post-graduate local programmes Note 4 ; 

 exchange in full-time locally-accredited local programmes at sub-degree level for not more than 6 months or exchange in full-time locally-accredited local or non-local programmes at undergraduate or above level for not more than one year Note 3 ; or

 full-time short-term studies, subject to the following conditions:

 the programme concerned is offered by Hong Kong higher education institutions with degree-awarding powers (excluding their continuing and professional education arms); and

 the cumulative duration of short-term studies taken up by any student should not exceed 180 days within any 12-month period.

 In addition, Chinese residents of the Mainland may also apply to attend secondary school level short-term exchange programmes approved by the Education Bureau of not more than 2 weeks, if accompanied by Mainland teachers.

 For nationals of Laos, Nepal and Vietnam (sub-paragraph 2(c) above):

 studies in full-time locally-accredited local programmes at undergraduate or above level offered by the University Grants Committee (UGC)-funded institutions, but excluding: (i) self-financing programmes offered by the relevant institutions; (ii) programmes offered by the continuing and professional education arms of the relevant institutions; and (iii) exchange programme or short-term studies offered by the relevant institutions.

 In general, unless a person has the right of abode or right to land in the HKSAR, he/she requires a visa/entry permit to study in the HKSAR. While each application is determined on its individual merits, an applicant should meet normal immigration requirements (such as holding a valid travel document with adequate returnability to his/her country of residence or citizenship; be of clear criminal record and raise no security or criminal concerns to the HKSAR; have no likelihood of becoming a burden on the HKSAR, etc.) as well as the relevant specific eligibility criteria detailed above before he/she may be considered for the grant of a visa/entry permit. It should be noted that the eligibility criteria may be subject to change from time to time without prior notice.

 Note 1: 
Local programmes refer to programmes leading to degrees awarded by local degree-awarding institutions whereas non-local programmes refer to programmes leading to degrees awarded solely by non-local institutions, irrespective of whether the programmes are jointly run by local and non-local institutions.

 Note 2: 
The agreement between the Mainland and the HKSAR on mutual recognition of degree awards in higher education is not applicable to sub-degree qualifications (i.e. associate degree and higher diploma). Mainland students may come to attend sub-degree level local programmes in the HKSAR since there is no restriction in the Mainland prohibiting them to pursue further studies at educational institutions outside the Mainland on a personal basis.

 Note 3: 
Mainland students are allowed to study in full-time locally-accredited local programmes. Mainland students are also allowed to study in full-time locally-accredited non-local programmes at undergraduate or above level which have been approved by the Ministry of Education of the People&rsquo;s Republic of China.

 Note 4: 
The programmes to be taken up by Mainland students must be offered by the University Grants Committee-funded institutions.

 Entry of Dependants 

 Applicants admitted for study (in full-time undergraduate or post-graduate local programmes in local degree-awarding institutions) may apply to bring their spouse or the other party to same-sex civil partnership, same-sex civil union, &ldquo;same-sex marriage&rdquo;, opposite-sex civil partnership or opposite-sex civil union entered into by him/her in accordance with the local law in force of the place of celebration and with such status being legally and officially recognised by the local authorities of the place of celebration Note 5 , and unmarried dependent children under the age of 18 to the HKSAR under the prevailing dependant policy. Persons admitted or applying for admission for study will be the sponsors of their accompanying dependants to the HKSAR. An application for admission of a dependant may be favourably considered if normal immigration requirements and the following criteria are met:

 there is reasonable proof of a genuine relationship between the dependant and the sponsor;

 there is no known record to the detriment of the dependant; and

 the sponsor is able to support the dependant's living at a standard well above the subsistence level and provide him/her with suitable accommodation in the HKSAR.

 This entry arrangement does not apply to:

 former Mainland Chinese residents residing in the Macao SAR who have obtained Macao identity cards for less than seven years, unless they have acquired residence in the Macao SAR through the One-way Permit Scheme; and

 nationals of Afghanistan and Korea (Democratic People's Republic of).

 Such dependants will normally be granted an initial stay of 12 months upon entry which is subject to annual extension upon application. Such application will be considered only when the applicant continues to meet the eligibility criteria for entry for residence as dependants (including that there is no change in circumstances which would have otherwise resulted in loss of sponsorship for the applicant, e.g. change in marriage relationship between the dependent spouse and the sponsor, or death of sponsor) and the sponsor remains a bona fide Hong Kong resident living in the HKSAR. Under the existing policy, while dependants whose sponsors have been admitted into the HKSAR for study may take up study in the HKSAR, they are prohibited from taking up employment in the HKSAR unless they have obtained prior permission from the Director of Immigration.

 Note 5: 
For the avoidance of doubt, the terms &ldquo;civil partnership&rdquo; and &ldquo;civil union&rdquo; above mean a legal institution of a nature which is akin to spousal relationship in a marriage. The same-sex civil partnership, same-sex civil union, &ldquo;same-sex marriage&rdquo;, opposite-sex civil partnership and opposite-sex civil union entered into in accordance with laws outside Hong Kong are limited to only relationships which are legally and officially recognised in the places of celebration. Such relationships normally have the following features: (a) the entering into and dissolution of the relationship are governed by legislation of the place where it is entered into; (b) the relationship requires registration by the competent authority specified by the legislation of the place where it is entered into; (c) the registration is evidenced in a written instrument issued by the competent authority; and (d) parties to the relationship have a mutual commitment to a shared life akin to spouses to the exclusion of others on a permanent basis. Such relationships do not include de facto spouse, partners in cohabitation, fianc&eacute;/fianc&eacute;e, etc.

 Processing Time 

 It normally takes six weeks to process a visa/entry permit application for study upon receipt of all the required documents. The Immigration Department (hereafter &ldquo;ImmD&rdquo;) will not be able to start processing the application unless all the required documents and information have been received. Please refrain from making enquiries about the progress of the application unless it is absolutely necessary, as it may delay the processing of the application. 

 All applications are processed and determined by the ImmD. Approval of applications is entirely discretionary and is subject to changes in government policies. The Director of Immigration reserves absolute discretion to refuse any application even if the application meets all eligibility criteria.

For those studying other courses, they will normally be granted permission to stay for 12 months upon entry or in accordance with the duration of their studies, whichever is shorter.

 Persons admitted for study may apply for extension of stay, if necessary, within 4 weeks before their limit of stay expires to continue their study in the HKSAR. Such applications will be considered only when the applicants continue to meet the eligibility criteria for entry for study. Extension of stay, if approved, will normally be on a yearly basis or in accordance with the duration of their studies, as appropriate.

 Conditions of Stay 

 In general, a person who is admitted as student in the HKSAR shall be subject to the following conditions of stay:

 he/she shall become a student only at a specified school, university or other educational institution and undertake such course of study as may be approved by the Director of Immigration; and

 he/she shall not:

 take up any employment, whether paid or unpaid; or

 establish or join in any business.

 Notwithstanding the employment restrictions as mentioned above, non-local students of full-time locally-accredited local or non-local programmes at undergraduate level or above whose study period is not less than one academic year may take up internship subject to the following conditions:

 the internship must be study/curriculum-related and be arranged or endorsed by the institutions they are studying in Note 1 ; and

 the duration of the internship is up to one academic year, or one-third of the normal duration of the relevant full-time academic programme, whichever is shorter Note 2 . 

 There is no restriction on the nature of work, level of salary, location, number of working hours and employers for the internship arrangements.

 As regards non-local students enrolled in full-time locally-accredited sub-degree local programmes with a study period not less than 2 academic years, they may also apply to take up an internship if the following conditions are met:

 the internships must be mandatory, study/curriculum-related and be arranged / endorsed by the institutions they are studying in Note 1 ; and

 the duration of the internship is up to 6 months Note 2&3 .

 part-time on-campus employment Note 4 for not more than 20 hours per week Note 5 throughout the year; and

 employment during the summer months from 1 June to 31 August (both dates inclusive) without any limit in relation to work hours and location.

 Nevertheless, non-local students (excluding exchange students) of full-time locally-accredited local programmes at undergraduate level or above whose study period is not less than one academic year are temporarily exempted from the above employment restrictions that they may take up employment in Hong Kong during the currency of their limit of stay or within the effective period as specified in the &ldquo;No Objection Letter&rdquo; (NOL) issued to them (if applicable), whichever is the shorter.

 Eligible students will be notified of the internship, part-time on-campus employment and/or summer job arrangement individually by a NOL which will spell out the type(s) and conditions of employment which the student may take up.

 Note 1: 
The study/curriculum-related internship must be endorsed by designated officers of the relevant institution, not by individual offices, schools, faculties or faculty members.

 Note 2: 
The internship cannot take place before a non-local student has officially registered with the institution and begun attending any scheduled classes of his/her registered programme in Hong Kong, or when the student concerned has already fulfilled all the course/credit requirements for graduation (e.g. a student who has just finished his/her final year of study).

 Note 3: 
For Higher Diploma programmes: The 6 months' duration is calculated on a cumulative basis of 182 days and is counted by calendar day. For sub-degree programmes other than Higher Diploma programmes : The 6 months' duration is calculated on a cumulative basis of 26 weeks and is counted by calendar week as a unit regardless of the actual days being engaged in the internship within a week. The cumulative duration of 182 days or 26 weeks need not be continuous.

 Note 4: 
The employment must take place within the campus of the institution (including only the campus of the institution which the non-local student is enrolled in, and excluding the campus of any subsidiary and associated bodies of the relevant institution proper or its self-financing arms) where the non-local student is studying or, if the work location is outside the campus of the institution, the employer is the institution itself.

 Note 5: 
Students are not allowed to roll-over unused hours from one week to another.

 Termination of Study 

 If the educational institution or student for any reason terminates studies before the completion of such a study course as approved by the Director of Immigration, the educational institution should notify the Director of Immigration of the date of termination of study in writing with reasons for termination or provide the Director of Immigration with a completed "Notification of Termination of Studies" ( ID 977 ) within 7 working days following the termination. The educational institution can also submit the &ldquo;Notification of Termination of Studies&rdquo; online through the ImmD online service system. 

 Re-entry into Hong Kong 

 Non-permanent residents of the HKSAR, irrespective of their nationality and type of travel document held, do not require a re-entry visa/entry permit to enter the HKSAR provided that they return within the currency of their permitted limit of stay and that the circumstances upon which they have acquired their residential status remain unchanged.

 Introduction 

 This webpage sets out information about extension of stay for non-Mainland residents admitted as student and their dependants.

 Eligibility Criteria 

 In general, non-local students admitted to take up studies in full-time locally-accredited local and non-local post-secondary programmes will be granted a length of stay in line with the normal duration of their study programmes, subject to a maximum period of six years upon entry and the validity of the travel document held. For those studying other courses, they will normally be granted permission to stay for 12 months upon entry or in accordance with the duration of their studies, whichever is shorter.

 Persons admitted for study may apply for extension of stay, if necessary, within 4 weeks before their limit of stay expires to continue their study in the HKSAR. Such applications will be considered only when the applicants continue to meet the eligibility criteria for entry for study. Extension of stay, if approved, will normally be on a yearly basis or in accordance with the duration of their studies, as appropriate.

 A dependant may apply for extension of stay for residence in the HKSAR within four weeks before his/her limit of stay expires. Such applications will be considered only when the applicant continues to meet the eligibility criteria for entry for residence as dependants (including that there is no change in circumstances which would have otherwise resulted in loss of sponsorship for the applicant, e.g. change in marriage relationship between the dependent spouse and the sponsor, or death of sponsor) and the sponsor remains a bona fide Hong Kong resident living in the HKSAR.

 Dependants of persons who have been admitted into the HKSAR to take up studies will normally be granted an initial stay of 12 months upon entry which is subject to annual extension upon approval.

 Processing Time 

 Routine applications will normally be finalised within two to three weeks upon receipt of all necessary documents.

 The processing time is subject to the circumstances of individual applications and the number of applications received at the time. A longer processing time may be required during summer rush period between June and August.
